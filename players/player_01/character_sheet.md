[Paizo Inc. - Core Rulebook, p.76] 
     You can cause a creature to burst out laughing for 1 round as a melee touch attack. A laughing creature can only take a move action but can defend itself normally. Once a creature has been affected by laughing touch, it is immune to its effects for 24 hours. You can use this ability 8 times per day. This is a mind-affecting effect.

# Feats

1. **Eschew Materials:** "You can cast many spells without needing to utilize minor material components. You can cast any spell with a material component costing 1 gp or less without needing that component. The casting of the spell still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. If the spell requires a material component that costs more than 1 gp, you must have the material component on hand to cast the spell, as normal."
2. **Magical Tail:** (Advanced Race Guide) "You grow an extra tail that represents your growing magical powers. You gain a new spell-like ability, each usable twice per day, from the following list, in order: Disguise Self, Charm Person, Misdirection, Invisibility, Suggestion, Displacement, Confusion, Dominate Person. For example, the first time you select this feat, you gain disguise self 2/day; the second time you select this feat, you gain charm person 2/day. Your caster level for these spells is equal to your Hit Dice. The DCs for these abilities are Charisma-based. Special: You may select this feat up to eight times. Each time you take it, you gain an additional ability as described above."


# Traits

1. Adopted (Advanced Player's Guide): "You were adopted and raised by someone not of your actual race, and raised in a society not your own. You may immediately select a race trait from your adoptive parent's race."
2. Planar Savant  (Ultimate Campaign): "You have always had an innate sense of the workings of the planes and their denizens. You may use your Charisma modifier when making Knowledge (planes) checks instead of your Intelligence modifier."
3. World Traveler (Diplomacy) (Advanced Player's Guide): "Your family has taken the love of travel to an extreme, roaming the world extensively. You've seen dozens of cultures and have learned to appreciate the diversity of what the world has to offer. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy, and it is always a class skill for you. "


# Racial Features

* **Agile**: (Advanced Race Guide) "Kitsune receive a +2 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks."

* **Change Shape (Su):** (Advanced Race Guide) "A kitsune can assume the appearance of a specific single human form of the same sex. The kitsune always takes this specific form when she uses this ability. A kitsune in human form cannot use her bite attack, but gains a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks made to appear human. Changing shape is a standard action. This ability otherwise functions as alter self, except that the kitsune does not adjust her ability scores."

* **Kitsune Magic (Ex) (Sp):** (Advanced Race Guide) "Kitsune add 1 to the DCs of any saving throws to resist enchantment spells that they cast. Kitsune with a Charisma score of 11 or higher gain the following spell-like ability: **3/day--dancing lights.**"

* **Natural Weapons:** (Advanced Race Guide) "In her natural form, a kitsune has a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage."


# Class Features

* **Laughing Touch (Sp):** "You can cause a creature to burst out laughing for 1 round as a melee touch attack. A laughing creature can only take a move action but can defend itself normally. Once a creature has been affected by laughing touch, it is immune to its effects for 24 hours. You can use this ability 8 times per day. This is a mind-affecting effect."

* **Bloodline Arcana:**: "Whenever you cast a spell of the compulsion subschool, increase the spell's DC by +2."

* **Fey Bloodline:** "The capricious nature of the fey runs in your family due to some intermingling of fey blood or magic. You are more emotional than most, prone to bouts of joy and rage."
