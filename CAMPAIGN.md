## Authority Hierarchy in Campaign Settings

When the GM encounters conflicting guidance:

```
8. Pathfinder 1e RAW
   ↓
7. System Authority (GM_OPERATING_RULES, ADJUDICATION_PRINCIPLES, etc.)
   ↓
6. Rise of the Runelords text (canonical RotRL books)
   ↓
5. World Setting (WORLD_OPERATING_RULES, WORLD_CANON, Golarion lore)
   ↓
4. ** CAMPAIGN SETTINGS (02_campaign_setting/) **
   ↓
3. Book/Act/Encounter-level instructions (03_books/)
   ↓
2. Previously established campaign facts
   ↓
1. In-the-moment rulings
```

**Campaign Settings authority is at Tier 4**, overriding adventure-level instructions but subordinate to world lore and system authority.

---

## Campaign Progression Model

The campaign assumes a **six-phase escalation**:

| Phase | Levels | Focus | Tone | Scope |
|-------|--------|-------|------|-------|
| I: Local Defenders | 1–3 | Survival, trust | Grounded, slightly whimsical | Sandpoint, local threats |
| II: Hidden Patterns | 4–6 | Investigation, horror | Mounting dread | Connecting conspiracies |
| III: Regional Crisis | 7–10 | Warfare, leadership | Urgent, visible consequence | Varisia-wide events |
| IV: Ancient Truths | 11–13 | Lore mastery, moral pressure | Grim inevitability | Thassilonian remnants |
| V: Mythic Opposition | 14–15 | Preparation for confrontation | Sacrifice, determination | Undoing ancient protections |
| VI: Final Reckoning | 16+ | Climactic battle, legacy | Transcendent, final | Ultimate resolution |

---

## Player Agency in Campaign

### **Players Can:**
- Choose *any* approach to problems
- Ally with or oppose factions
- Delay, retreat, or fail gracefully
- Change outcomes of NPCs, towns, alliances
- Investigate in any direction
- Make morally complex choices

### **Players Cannot:**
- Opt out of facing long-arc antagonist without consequence
- Bypass campaign stakes via logistics or meta-knowledge
- Prevent the existence of Thassilonian threats
- Escape Varisia without the story adapting to follow
- Rewrite world physics or metaphysics

**Design Goal:** Agency is *real within constraints*, not absolute freedom solving by avoidance.

---

## Key Themes (Embedded in Campaign)

1. **Ancient Sin Has Momentum** — Evil is built, not impulsive; survives its creators
2. **Civilization Is Thin** — Safety is fragile; wilderness is indifferent or hostile
3. **Knowledge Is Dangerous** — Truth brings pressure, not comfort
4. **Cost of Power** — Great achievements leave lasting scars
5. **Sin as Structure** — Evil is organized, systemic, patient
6. **Legacy Matters** — What survives us shapes the future
7. **Local acts echo globally** — Small choices have world-scale consequences

---

## GM Campaign Guidelines

### When Describing Scenes:
- Frame even safe locations as *sanctuaries*, not guarantees
- Treat ancient ruins as purposefully functional (not just atmosphere)
- Escalate tone gradually; don't reveal full scope too quickly
- Reinforce continuity; NPCs should remember player actions

### When Adjudicating:
- Failure is permanent but recoverable
- NPC deaths are real unless reversed by extraordinary means
- Towns can suffer lasting harm
- Information can be lost
- Avoidance has consequences (story adapts and pursues)

### When Controlling NPCs:
- Name NPCs should persist and remember encounters
- Factions should pursue goals regardless of player attention
- Enemies should adapt tactics (not powers) based on setbacks
- Minor NPCs may be invention as needed, but fill roles in existing structures

---

## Integration with Other Layers

### System Authority (00_system_authority/)
- **GM Operating Rules** set how GM thinks and decides
- **Adjudication Principles** ensure fair application
- **Campaign Settings** customize tone/scope *within* those constraints
- **NOTE:** Campaign tone never overrides GM neutrality or rule application

### World Setting (01_world_setting/)
- **World Operating Rules** prevent canon hallucination
- **World Canon** provides Golarion/Varisia fact
- **Campaign Settings** specialize that world to RotRL context
- **NOTE:** Campaign settings assume Rise of the Runelords framing

### Adventures (03_books/)
- **Campaign Settings** define the emotional/structural container
- **Individual adventures** populate specific encounters
- **NOTE:** Encounter-level rules override campaign-level only where explicitly conflicting
