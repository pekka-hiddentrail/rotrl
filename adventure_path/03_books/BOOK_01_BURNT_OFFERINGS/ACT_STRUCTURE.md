# Book I – Burnt Offerings

## Act Structure

This book is structured in **three acts**. Each act escalates threat and knowledge while deepening the party’s relationship to Sandpoint. Acts are not scripts; scenes may be skipped, reordered, or partially resolved without breaking the campaign.


## Act I – Swallowtail Festival

### Narrative Function

Introduce Sandpoint as a living community and establish the PCs as *present* before they are heroes. Violence arrives suddenly, but without cosmic weight—yet.

This act teaches players:

* Sandpoint is worth caring about
* Chaos can erupt without warning
* Not all threats announce themselves


### Entry Conditions

* PCs are in Sandpoint during the Swallowtail Festival
* PCs have social exposure to at least one major Sandpoint NPC

If the PCs are not locals, the festival functions as a social onboarding event.


### Mandatory Revelations

These truths must emerge, regardless of path:

* Goblins are unusually bold and organized
* Sandpoint is unprepared for sustained violence
* The PCs are capable of responding when others cannot

How these are discovered is flexible.


### Optional Paths

* Festival games and social bonding
* Individual NPC spotlights
* Early goblin pursuit or interrogation

These primarily affect *relationships*, not plot access.


### Escalation Triggers

* If goblins escape: future raids become more coordinated
* If civilian casualties are high: Sandpoint morale drops
* If PCs disengage: Sheriff Hemlock mobilizes without them


### Exit State

* PCs are publicly recognized as defenders
* Sandpoint transitions from celebration to vigilance


## Act II – Shadows in Sandpoint

### Narrative Function

Reveal that the goblin raid was not an isolated incident. The threat is now *internal*, hidden beneath familiar streets and trusted faces.

This act reframes the danger as:

* Personal
* Persistent
* Rooted in history


### Entry Conditions

* PCs pursue goblin activity, local disturbances, or official requests
* Sandpoint authority figures trust the PCs enough to share concerns


### Mandatory Revelations

* Goblin activity traces back to a larger source
* Ancient ruins exist beneath Sandpoint
* Symbols of Thassilon appear (Sihedron Rune), unexplained but deliberate


### Optional Paths

* Glassworks investigation
* Catacombs exploration
* NPC backstory revelations
* Early clues about Nualia’s fall

These paths determine *how much context* the PCs gain before the final act.


### Escalation Triggers

* If the Glassworks is delayed: sabotage worsens
* If catacombs are ignored: further corruption spreads unseen
* If Nualia’s story is uncovered early: final confrontation shifts tone


### Exit State

* PCs understand Sandpoint is built on older foundations
* The threat is no longer random—it is directed


## Act III – Thistletop

### Narrative Function

Transition from local defense to proactive intervention. The PCs leave Sandpoint to confront the source of the threat and uncover the first tangible relic of Runelord-era power.

This act establishes:

* Ancient evil is active, not myth
* The world is larger and more dangerous than Sandpoint
* Victory can still feel costly


### Entry Conditions

* PCs identify Thistletop (or equivalent goblin stronghold) as the source
* PCs choose to act rather than wait

---

### Mandatory Revelations

* Goblins are being guided, not acting alone
* A Runewell exists and functions
* Nualia’s corruption mirrors future campaign threats


### Optional Paths

* Diplomatic or deceptive infiltration
* Partial dungeon resolution
* Mercy, execution, or abandonment of Nualia

All options carry consequences forward.


### Escalation Triggers

* If Thistletop is assaulted recklessly: Sandpoint suffers reprisals
* If the Runewell is mishandled: residual magic lingers
* If Nualia survives: she becomes a living scar in the campaign


### Exit State

* Thistletop is neutralized or abandoned
* The Runewell is disrupted, not fully understood
* Sandpoint survives, changed

The PCs are no longer reacting to threats—they are now part of a larger story.
