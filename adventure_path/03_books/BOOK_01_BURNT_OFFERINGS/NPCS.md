# Book I – Burnt Offerings

## NPCs

This document defines **campaign-significant NPCs** introduced or established in Burnt Offerings. These NPCs are not interchangeable; their survival, trust, or loss creates persistent effects that carry into later books.

NPCs are grouped by **persistence tier** rather than narrative importance.


## Tier I – Structural NPCs (Load-Bearing)

These NPCs anchor Sandpoint’s identity. Their loss permanently alters how the town functions.


### Kendra Deverin – Mayor of Sandpoint

**Narrative Function:**

* Represents pragmatic authority and civic continuity
* Serves as the town’s public face toward the PCs

**If Cooperative:**

**If Killed:**

* Law enforcement collapses into ad-hoc militias
* Crime and paranoia increase


## Tier II – Emotional Anchors

These NPCs define why Sandpoint matters *emotionally*. Their fate determines whether the town feels like home.


### Ameiko Kaijitsu – Innkeeper, Adventurer at Heart

**Role:** Social hub, cultural bridge

**Narrative Function:**

* Humanizes Sandpoint
* Connects PCs to everyday life

**If Friendly:**

* PCs gain informal support and rumors

**If Killed:**

* The town loses a unifying figure
* Celebration and levity fade noticeably


### Father Abstalar Zantus – Priest of Desna

**Role:** Spiritual guidance, moral compass

**Narrative Function:**

* Softens horror with meaning

**If Cooperative:**

* Provides insight into dreams, omens, and hope

**If Distrustful:**

* Withholds spiritual interpretation

**If Killed:**

* Fear replaces faith


## Tier III – Transformational NPCs

These NPCs exist to **demonstrate corruption, obsession, or change**. Their arcs echo forward into the campaign.


### Nualia Tobyn – Fallen Acolyte

**Role:** Antagonist, thematic prototype

**Narrative Function:**

* Illustrates how ancient influence exploits personal pain
* Mirrors potential PC failure paths

**Key Truths:**

* Her fall predates the goblin raids
* She believes herself justified

**Bridge Status:**

* Cross-Book Potential: No (resolves in Book I)
* Campaign Function: Prototype for later corruption

**If Redeemed:**

* Becomes a living reminder of mercy and consequence
* Her existence complicates future moral choices

**If Killed:**

* Serves as a warning rather than a legacy

**If Escapes:**

* May reappear indirectly as rumor, cult influence, or myth

Nualia should never be treated as disposable.


### Aldern Foxglove – Troubled Noble

**Role:** Observer, obsession vector, campaign bridge

**Narrative Function:**

* Demonstrates how personal weakness precedes monstrosity
* Seeds later horror through mundane interaction

**Key Truths:**

* Aldern is already unstable during this book
* His fixation forms quietly and asymmetrically

**Bridge Status:**

* Cross-Book Potential: Yes
* Intended Resolution: Book II (The Skinsaw Murders)
* Early Termination Handling: Required

**In Book I Behavior:**

* Appears grateful, charming, and generous
* Forms a one-sided attachment to one or more PCs
* Commits no overt crimes during this book

**If Befriended:**

* Obsession becomes personal and dangerous

**If Ignored:**

* Obsession intensifies privately

**If Rebuffed:**

* Resentment accelerates his descent

**If Killed:**

* Book II must be restructured around his absence

Aldern should never demand attention; his importance is only visible in hindsight.


## Tier IV – Functional NPCs

These NPCs serve specific purposes but can be replaced with minimal campaign damage.


### Lonjiku Kaijitsu – Glassworks Owner

**Role:** Economic pressure point

**Narrative Function:**

**If Killed:**

* Truth may emerge later through investigation


## NPC Memory Rules

* NPCs remember *patterns*, not isolated actions
* Trust changes slowly; betrayal lingers
* Death is permanent unless explicitly overturned by campaign authority

All NPC state changes should be recorded in emergent canon.
