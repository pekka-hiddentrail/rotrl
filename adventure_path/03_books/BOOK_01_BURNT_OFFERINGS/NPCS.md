# Burnt Offerings – NPC Reference (AI-GM)

**Scope:** Pathfinder AP – Rise of the Runelords, Book 1: *Burnt Offerings*
**Purpose:** Canonical NPC authority file for AI-GM use. This document defines campaign-significant NPCs, their persistence behavior, and enforced handling rules. These NPCs are **not interchangeable**; their survival, trust, or loss creates persistent effects across the Adventure Path.
