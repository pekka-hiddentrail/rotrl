# Rise of the Runelords – Book I Context and Integrated Background

## The Long Shadow of Thassilon

Five years ago, hundreds of miles from the Varisian coast, the stone giant **Mokmurian** awakened a power best left forgotten: **Runelord Karzoug**, tyrant of ancient Shalast and master of the sin of greed. During Thassilon’s height, Karzoug drew power from the **Sihedron**, the sevenfold rune embodying the primal sins that underpinned Thassilonian magic.

Karzoug survived Thassilon’s fall by means of an ancient device known as a **runewell**, a soul-harvesting engine attuned to greed. Through a potent scrying focus called a **soul lens**, Karzoug draws the souls of creatures marked with the Sihedron Rune and sacrificed according to ancient ritual. These stolen essences fuel his slow return to life.

To prepare the world, Karzoug enslaved Mokmurian and sent him forth as his hand and voice. Giantkind, marked with the Sihedron and driven into escalating violence, became both soldiers and sacrificial fuel. Yet Karzoug’s awakening had consequences beyond his intent.

When Karzoug’s runewell activated, it resonated across Varisia. Other runewells—long dormant, scattered, sunken, or buried—flared briefly to life.

Most went unnoticed.

One did not.

## The Wrath Beneath Sandpoint

Beneath the coastal town of **Sandpoint**, in the **Catacombs of Wrath**, lies a minor runewell once belonging to **Runelord Alaznist**, mistress of wrath. When Karzoug’s runewell surged, Alaznist’s flared in response.

The effect was subtle but devastating.

A wave of corrupted magic rippled upward into Sandpoint, manifesting as violent nightmares and sudden, irrational fury. For most, the rage passed like a fever dream.

For three souls, it did not.

* **Lonjiku Kaijitsu**, a bitter noble steeped in decades of resentment, murdered his wife and cast her from their cliffside manor.
* **Jervis Stoot**, a haunted artisan scarred by abuse, began plotting the deaths of those he believed had wronged him.
* **Nualia Tobyn**, abandoned, shamed, and consumed by hatred, forsook Desna and pledged herself to **Lamashtu**, goddess of monsters and madness.

Their actions—and those they inspired—became known as **the Late Unpleasantness**.

The fires eventually burned out. Stoot died. Lonjiku’s crime went largely unnoticed. Nualia vanished.

Sandpoint endured.

Or so it believed.

## The Present Moment

Five years later, Sandpoint prepares to consecrate a new cathedral, raised upon the ashes of the one Nualia destroyed. The town is determined to move forward, to bury memory beneath celebration.

But Nualia has not been idle.

The ancient forces beneath Sandpoint still stir. The Catacombs remember. Wrath does not fade—it waits.

And Sandpoint stands once more at the edge of history.

# Book I – Burnt Offerings

## Role in the Campaign

*Burnt Offerings* is the **foundation volume** of *Rise of the Runelords*.

Its purpose is not merely to present goblin raids or local threats, but to:

* Anchor the campaign emotionally in **Sandpoint**
* Introduce **Thassilonian magic** as a living, corrupting legacy
* Seed **Karzoug’s influence** long before his name is known

This book is about **belonging**, **trust**, and the first realization that something ancient is watching.

If this book succeeds, later conflicts are not about saving the world—but about saving *home*.

## Intended Character Levels

* **Start:** Level 1
* **End:** Level 4

Early progression should feel safe and steady. By the end, advancement should feel earned—and slightly unsettling.

## Core Themes

* Community versus isolation
* Celebration interrupted by violence
* Ancient evils leaking through mundane cracks
* The past refusing to stay buried

Horror is restrained. Fear escalates gradually. Sandpoint must always feel worth protecting.

## Narrative Responsibilities

This book must:

* Establish Sandpoint NPCs as **persistent, recurring people**
* Present goblins as **symptoms**, not the disease
* Reveal that Thassilonian forces are **still active**
* Teach that **locations remember**, react, and change

Failure should scar the world, not end the campaign.

## Relationship to the Long Arc

* Karzoug remains unnamed, but his **methods** are visible
* The **Sihedron Rune** is introduced visually and symbolically
* **Runewells** are introduced conceptually, without full explanation

Players should feel intention behind events—even without understanding it.

## Failure-Forward Philosophy

Burnt Offerings is forgiving, but never inert.

* Heavy casualties reduce future support
* Lost NPCs are replaced—but without shared history
* Ignored threats escalate off-screen

No outcome invalidates the campaign. No outcome is consequence-free.

## Exit State

By the end of Book I:

* Sandpoint still stands—but is changed
* The PCs are recognized as protectors, willingly or not
* Something ancient has stirred and cannot be put back to sleep

The world is no longer safe.

But it is still familiar.
