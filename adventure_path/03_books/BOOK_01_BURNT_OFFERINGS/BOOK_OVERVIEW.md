# Book I – Burnt Offerings

## Role in the Campaign

Burnt Offerings serves as the *foundation book* of the campaign. Its primary purpose is not the goblin threat itself, but the establishment of **Sandpoint as an emotional anchor**, the introduction of **Runelord-era magic**, and the quiet seeding of **Karzoug’s influence** long before his name carries weight.

This book is about *belonging, trust, and the first cracks in normalcy*.

If this book works, players will later fight not just to save the world, but to save *home*.


## Intended Character Levels

* Start: Level 1
* End: Level 4

Level progression should feel steady and reassuring early, then subtly earned by the end as the tone darkens.


## Core Themes

* Community vs. isolation
* Celebration interrupted by violence
* Ancient evil leaking through mundane cracks
* The past refusing to stay buried

Horror elements are *restrained* here. Fear escalates gradually and should never overwhelm the sense that Sandpoint is worth protecting.


## Narrative Responsibilities

This book must:

* Establish Sandpoint NPCs as recurring, persistent individuals
* Introduce goblins as chaotic symptoms, not the real disease
* Reveal that ancient Thassilonian forces still act upon the world
* Teach players that locations can remember, react, and change

Failure to complete this book cleanly should not end the campaign, but it *must* leave scars.


## Relationship to Long-Arc Threats

* Karzoug is not named, but his *methods* are visible
* The Sihedron Rune is introduced visually and symbolically
* Runewells are established as a concept without full explanation

Players should sense intention behind events, even if they cannot yet identify an enemy.


## Failure-Forward Philosophy

Burnt Offerings is forgiving but not inert.

Examples:

* If Sandpoint suffers heavy casualties, later books reflect reduced support and trust
* If key NPCs die, replacements exist but lack the same history
* If threats are ignored, they escalate *off-screen* rather than stalling

No outcome should invalidate the campaign, but no outcome should be consequence-free.

## Exit State

By the end of this book:

* Sandpoint is changed, but standing
* The PCs are recognized as protectors (willingly or not)
* Something ancient has been disturbed and cannot be put back to sleep

The world is no longer safe — but it is still familiar.
