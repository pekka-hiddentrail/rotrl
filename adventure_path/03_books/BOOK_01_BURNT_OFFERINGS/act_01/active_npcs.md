## NPC Availability Rules

### Before Goblin Attack
* Tier I & II NPCs are present and approximately on schedule
* Tier III (Aldern) may approach if PCs are prominent
* Tier IV (Lonjiku, Tsuto) are off-schedule or unavailable

### During Goblin Attack
* ALL available NPCs respond (some defensively, some seeking shelter)
* Sheriff and militia mobilize immediately
* Some NPCs become separated or focused on survival
* Scene becomes chaotic; specific NPC positioning is flexible

### After Goblin Attack
* Tier I NPCs become formal/administrative
* Tier II NPCs become emotionally affected (fear, relief, concern)
* Tier III NPCs surface if relevant to investigation
* Tier IV NPCs remain relatively stable (business-focused)

## Interaction Tips for the GM

* **Before Violence:** Use NPCs to introduce Sandpoint's culture and relationships
* **During Violence:** NPCs are distracted; brief interactions unless combat-relevant
* **After Violence:** NPCs have emotional reactions; use for consequence assessment and plot hooks

See **NPCS.md** in the parent directory for detailed NPC stat blocks and personality profiles.
