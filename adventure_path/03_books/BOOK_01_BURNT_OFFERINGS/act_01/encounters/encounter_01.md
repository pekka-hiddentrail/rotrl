## Battlefield Layout

**Festival Grounds: ~60x80 feet cleared arena space**

```
        N (Forest)
        
    [Forest Edge]
    [Goblin spawn zone - 40 ft away]
    
OOOO    (Crowd of civilians in bleachers/standing)

## #### ## (Merchant tents/stalls - provide light cover)

        [Stage] (Mayor/VIPs present)

        S (Town entrance, Sheriff & militia 30 ft away)
```

**Key Terrain:**
- **Merchant tents:** Provide cover (AC +2) but are flammable/destructible
- **Bleachers:** Civilians seated; goblins will attack if unprotected
- **Open ground:** 40-ft run-in for goblins; disadvantageous for defenders without ranged attacks
- **Town buildings:** 30 ft south; militia begins arriving turn 2

---

## Combat Phases

### Round 1: Goblin Charge (Surprise Round)

**Setup:**
* Goblins charge into the festival grounds at 60 ft/round
* Goblins make Perception vs. PC Stealth: most PCs are surprised (not expecting combat)
* Goblins attack on "their first turn" (they have surprise)

**Goblin Actions (Surprise):**
- Dire wolf mounted leader charges closest target
- Archers loose arrows at crowd (or at any PC visible)
- Infantry follows 10 ft behind, ready to engage

**PC Options (if not surprised):**
* Ready actions (Readied attack if goblin moves into range)
* Ranged attacks (If PC has bow/spell at range 60 ft+)
* Movement (Run toward goblins or defend civilians)

**Civilian Impact:**
* **Without PC intervention:** 1d4 civilians take 1d6 arrow damage (none die unless critically hit)
* **With PC intervention:** PCs can block arrows (AC check) or warn crowd (Charisma/Perform check reduces damage)

---

### Round 2+: Full Combat

**Initiative:** Roll initiative after surprise round  

**Key Mechanical Points:**

| Action | Mechanics | Effect |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Targeting goblins | Attack roll vs. AC 14-15 | Standard combat resolution |
| Protecting civilians | Interpose your position OR warn them to flee | Reduces casualties |
| Flanking | Achieve during melee | +2 bonus to attack rolls |
| Area attacks (spells) | Hit all creatures in area (including civilians if in range) | Collateral damage likely |

**Goblin Morale:**
- 1st casualty: Goblins continue attacking
- 3rd+ casualty: Check morale (DC 10 Wisdom check for goblin leader)
  - Failure: Goblins rout (flee north back into forest)
  - Success: Goblins hold or escalate

**Sheriff & Militia Arrival:**
- **Round 2-3:** Sheriff Hemlock and 3-4 militia arrive as reinforcements
- **Effect:** Goblins are now outnumbered heavily; morale check becomes harder
- **Note:** Militia handle their own combats; PCs are primary heroes

---

## Encounter Tactics (Goblin AI)

**Leader's Goal:** Chaos and intimidation; if leader dies, goblins flee

**Archers' Goal:** Soft targets (civilians, spellcasters); retreat if flanked

**Infantry's Goal:** Close-range combat; protect ranged units

**Escape Plan:** If more than half numbers lost, flee north back to forest

**No Suicide:** Goblins won't stay and die; will route if clearly losing

---

## Environmental Hazards

* **Fire (if area is set ablaze):** Treat tents/wooden structures as catch fire (DC 12); deal 1d6 fire damage to adjacent creatures per round
* **Crowd panic:** Large spells (fireball, etc.) risk causing panic; saving throw DC 12 to avoid fleeing

---

## Treasure & Loot

**Goblin Equipment (Standard):**
- Scimitars (value: 15 gp each)
- Shortbows (value: 30 gp each)  
- Leather armor (value: 10 gp each)
- Dire wolf mounts (NOT lootable in combat; flee with riders if goblins rout)

**Total Potential Loot:** ~200-300 gp (modest for level 1)

**Captured Goblin (if alive):**
- Interrogation DC 12 (Intimidate or Diplomacy/Charisma)
- Provides info: "We camp at Thistletop. War Chief Ripnugget wants tribute, grrr!"
- Advancement to Act II investigation hook

---

## Experience Award

**Combat Victory (goblins routed/killed):** 600 XP total  
- Divide by number of PCs; ~150 XP per PC if party of 4

**Bonus XP:**
- Capturing goblin alive: +50 XP
- Killing leader: +25 XP
- Protecting named NPC: +50 XP each

---

## Consequences & Outcomes

### If Goblins Routed Quickly
- **Pressure +1** (relief, grateful townspeople)
- NPCs view PCs as heroes
- Investigation into goblin origins begins

### If High Civilian Casualties (5+)
- **Pressure +2** (shock, fear of return raids)
- Grieving families may approach PCs
- Economic fallout (reduced trade if people flee)

### If Goblins Escape (more than half numbers)
- **Pressure +2** (fear of retaliation)
- Future raids will be more coordinated
- Sheriff will seek PC help for subsequent defense

### If Leader Captured
- Enables interrogation for Act II hooks
- Goblins lose coordination in future encounters

---

## GM Notes

* **Tone:** First real combat; establish that actions matter and consequences are real
* **Pacing:** Don't stretch combat over multiple sessions; resolve in 1-2 sessions max
* **Drama:** Describe the chaos vividly—music stopping, people screaming, blood on cobblestones
* **NPC Deaths:** Avoid killing named NPCs unless PCs massively fail; killing background civilians is acceptable
* **Aftermath:** Use this encounter to establish PC heroes in town; NPCs will remember who fought hardest
