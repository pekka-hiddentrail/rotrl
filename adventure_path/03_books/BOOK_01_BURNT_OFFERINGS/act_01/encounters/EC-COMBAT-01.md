# EC-COMBAT-01

- **ID:** EC-COMBAT-01
- **Name:** Goblins in the Square
- **Scope:**  
  Begins when three goblins break from the crowd and engage the PCs in the Cathedral Plaza during the Swallowtail Festival raid.  
  Ends when all three goblins are dead, unconscious, captured, or have successfully fled the plaza area (beyond 120 ft from engagement point).


## Narrative Description

Swallowtail Festival in progress. Cathedral plaza crowded with civilians. Three goblins armed with dogslicers and torches rush into the open plaza from between vendor stalls. Panic spreads immediately. Civilians begin fleeing in random directions, creating difficult terrain conditions. One goblin attempts to ignite property while the other two focus on attacking armed targets.

No organized town guard presence within immediate 30 ft at encounter start.


## NPCs / Enemies

### Goblin Warrior (3)
**System Reference:** Pathfinder RPG Bestiary – Goblin (CR 1/3 each)

**Initial Positioning:**
- Goblin 1: 30 ft from PCs, near vendor cart
- Goblin 2: 40 ft from PCs, advancing directly
- Goblin 3: 20 ft from PCs, carrying lit torch

**Goal:**
- Cause chaos
- Injure civilians or lightly armored PCs
- Set something on fire before retreat

**Tactics:**
- Goblins use Acrobatics to move through crowd if necessary
- Goblin with torch attempts to ignite nearest flammable object (vendor cloth, banner, stall)
- They prefer flanking if possible
- They avoid heavily armored targets unless cornered

**Morale:**
- If 2 goblins are killed or reduced below 0 HP, the remaining goblin attempts to flee
- If fire successfully ignites and PCs are distracted, surviving goblins withdraw

**Trigger Behaviors:**
- If surrounded on two sides → withdraw using Acrobatics
- If reduced to 3 HP or fewer → full retreat action
- If civilian is prone within 5 ft → attempt attack for opportunistic chaos


## Location

**Sandpoint Cathedral Plaza**

- Open stone plaza approximately 80 ft x 80 ft
- Cathedral stairs to north (10 ft elevation, counts as difficult terrain if crowded)
- 3 vendor stalls (wood + cloth; AC 5, hardness 2, 15 HP)
- Swallowtail banner lines (flammable)
- Central ceremonial bonfire (5 ft radius; entering square deals 1d6 fire damage)

**Terrain Effects:**
- Civilians within first 2 rounds count as difficult terrain
- After 2 rounds, civilians disperse and terrain clears except near Cathedral steps
- Vendor stalls provide light cover (+2 AC)
- If a stall is ignited:
  - Fire spreads 5 ft per round unless extinguished
  - Adjacent squares become hazardous (1 fire damage per round of contact)

**Lighting:**
- Daylight conditions


## Resolution(s)

### 1. All Goblins Defeated Before Fire Spreads
- No structural damage
- Civilians unharmed
- PCs visibly heroic
- Local disposition toward PCs improves
- Sheriff Hemlock notes competence


### 2. Fire Ignites but Goblins Defeated
- One vendor stall destroyed
- Minor property damage
- PCs may need to assist in extinguishing flames (Reflex DC 10 to avoid minor burns if adjacent)
- Mixed public reaction (gratitude but shaken mood)


### 3. One or More Goblins Escape
- Surviving goblin retreats into alleyways
- Potential tracking encounter later
- Rumors spread that goblins infiltrated town perimeter


### 4. PCs Withdraw or Fail to Engage
- At least one stall burns
- Possible civilian injury (non-fatal unless players ignored entirely)
- Reputation impact
- Sheriff Hemlock questions reliability


## Encounter End Protocol

- Remove civilians from tactical tracking
- Extinguish or persist fires according to outcome
- Record:
  - Structural damage (if any)
  - Goblin casualties
  - Escaped goblins
  - PC injuries and conditions
