## Mandatory Revelations

Regardless of PC approach, these facts MUST become known:

1. **Goblins are boldly attacking in daylight** (organized, not random)
2. **Sandpoint is militarily unprepared** (relies on the Sheriff and militia)

## Escalation Triggers

| Condition | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| Goblins escape the festival | Future raids show increased coordination (+1 Pressure) |
| High civilian casualties (3+) | Public panic increases; NPC trust becomes conditional |
| Multiple deaths | Sandpoint transitions to fear (Pressure +2) |
| PCs disengage | Sheriff takes control; PCs treated as capable but unreliable |

---

## Optional Scenes

* **Festival Games:** Opportunity to roleplay and build NPC relationships
* **Individual NPC Spotlights:** Social scenes before violence that flesh out Sandpoint
* **Early Goblin Pursuit:** Chase or interrogation sequence if PCs capture a goblin
* **Casualty Management:** Roleplayed moments with victims or families (affects Pressure)
