# Act I – Current Tensions

This document outlines the **active tensions and conflicts** present in Sandpoint during Act I, before the main goblin attack.

---

## Sandpoint's Underlying State (Pre-Attack)

Sandpoint appears peaceful and celebratory on the surface, but tensions exist beneath:

### Economic Stress

**Tension:** Lonjiku Kaijitsu's business ambitions conflict with Ameiko's generosity

* Lonjiku wants the Glassworks to be profitable, not charitable
* Ameiko treats the Rusty Dragon as a community gathering place (spending money on customers)
* This creates friction within the family but is mostly private

**Impact on PCs:** Minimal until Glassworks attack; then becomes plot-relevant

**How PCs May Interface:** Overhearing arguments, seeing Tsuto's resentment, learning about family divisions

---

### Family Resentment (Shadow)

**Tension:** Tsuto Kaijitsu harbors deep resentment toward his legitimate family

* Tsuto is illegitimate (half-brother to Ameiko)
* Feels excluded from family wealth and respect
* This drives his later sabotage (Act II), but not visible in Act I

**Impact on PCs:** Not apparent during Act I; mentioned only in investigation/rumor later

**How PCs May Interface:** None directly in Act I; tensions emerge in Act II investigation

---

### Social Hierarchy & Trust

**Tension:** Sandpoint's prosperity depends on fragile trust between different social groups

* Merchant families (like the Kaijitsus) control wealth
* The militia is thin and volunteers are unpaid
* The Sheriff relies on goodwill, not military power
* Uncertainty: What happens if the town is attacked?

**Impact on PCs:** The attack tests this fragile system; PCs' response shapes future NPC behavior

**How PCs May Interface:** During Act I festival, NPCs display ease or anxiety; during/after attack, trust is revealed as conditional

---

### Religious Division (Subtle)

**Tension:** Not explicitly mentioned, but Sandpoint has multiple faiths (Desna, Erastil, Abadar, etc.)

* Father Zantus (Desna) leads major ceremony
* Other faiths go unmarked or unacknowledged
* Potential for religious prejudice (not yet active, but exists)

**Impact on PCs:** Minimal in Act I; becomes relevant if PCs investigate later disappearances or cults

**How PCs May Interface:** If they ask about religion, NPCs may reveal minor preferences or biases

---

## Act I Specific Pressures

### Pre-Attack Festival Dynamics

**Celebration vs. Caution:**

* Most NPCs are relaxed and social
* But underlying anxiety exists: "Are we truly safe?"
* The Late Unpleasantness (past goblin wars) is remembered but downplayed

**NPC Behavior:** NPCs oscillate between celebration and concern; a loud noise makes people nervous

---

### The Goblin Threat (Off-Screen)

**What NPCs Don't Know (GM-ONLY):**

* Goblins are gathering in organized numbers
* They are being directed/influenced by Nualia
* The attack is coordinated and will happen *during the festival*

**What NPCs Suspect:**

* Minor goblin activity has increased recently
* Sheriff has been more vigilant
* Merchants worry about trade route safety

**How PCs Learn This:** Through casual NPC conversation before the attack; becomes urgent after

---

### Personal Strains

#### Ameiko & Lonjiku

**Visible Tension:** Ameiko seems happy-go-lucky, but is stressed about her father's demands

**NPC Interaction:** If PCs befriend Ameiko, she may reveal worry about family finances or her father's pressure

**Consequence:** During/after attack, family relationships shift (Ameiko's safety becomes Lonjiku's priority)

---

#### Sheriff Hemlock's Vigilance

**Visible Tension:** Sheriff is slightly more alert than townspeople consider necessary

**NPC Interaction:** If PCs ask, Hemlock admits he's "uneasy" but dismisses it as paranoia

**Consequence:** When attack happens, his preparedness is the *only reason Sandpoint isn't overrun*

---

## Pressure Escalation During Act I

### Before Attack: Pressure = 0

* Sandpoint is at peace (apparent)
* NPCs are relaxed and social
* Trust is default (PCs haven't proven anything yet)

### During Attack: Pressure +2

* Immediate panic (2 casualties minimum)
* Sheriff mobilizes
* Public safety becoming uncertain

### After Attack: Pressure +1 to +3 (based on outcomes)

* **Light attack (few casualties):** Pressure +1 (relief mixed with fear)
* **Moderate attack (several deaths):** Pressure +2 (shock, need for security)
* **Severe attack (many deaths OR structural damage):** Pressure +3 (panic, loss of faith in authorities)

---

## How PCs Reduce Tensions

### Through Preparation
* Learning about goblin threat through spying = Pressure -1 (feeling prepared)
* Fortifying locations = Pressure -1 (visible security)

### Through Action
* Defeating goblins efficiently = Pressure -1 (competence visible)
* Saving notable NPCs = Pressure -1 (heroism remembered)
* Helping with cleanup = Pressure -1 (community investment)

### Through Failure
* Allowing goblins to escape = Pressure +1 (fear of return)
* High casualties = Pressure +1 to +2 (compounding trauma)
* PCs withdrawing = Pressure +2 (loss of hope)

## NPC Reaction Framework

| Pressure Level | Ameiko | Sheriff | Mayor | Father Zantus |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0-1 | Welcoming | Professional | Confident | Spiritual |
| 2-3 | Nervous | Serious | Concerned | Protective |
| 4-5 | Frightened | Tactical | Uncertain | Warning |
| 6+ | Withdrawn | Harsh | Desperate | Prayerful |
