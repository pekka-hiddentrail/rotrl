# Book I – Burnt Offerings

## Locations

This document defines **narrative-significant locations** in Burnt Offerings. These entries do not describe room-by-room layouts or tactical maps. Instead, they define *purpose, secrets, and persistent consequences*.

Locations are expected to **change state** based on player action or inaction. Once changed, those states should be recorded in emergent canon and respected in later books.


## Sandpoint

### Narrative Function

Sandpoint is the emotional center of the early campaign. It represents normalcy, community, and something worth protecting.

Sandpoint is not static—it reacts to fear, heroism, neglect, and loss.


### Core Truths

* Sandpoint is young, ambitious, and fragile
* It is built atop older, partially forgotten ruins
* Authority is limited; leadership relies on trust


### Secrets

* Beneath Sandpoint lie remnants of Thassilonian structures
* These ruins subtly influence events above

These secrets need not be fully uncovered in this book.


### Persistent Changes

Possible long-term outcomes include:

* Increased civic trust in the PCs
* Lingering fear or paranoia
* Structural or population damage

Later books should reflect Sandpoint’s accumulated scars.


## Swallowtail Festival Grounds

### Narrative Function

A symbol of unity, tradition, and joy—used to contrast sharply with sudden violence.


### Core Truths

* The festival is public, crowded, and vulnerable
* It serves as a social cross-section of Sandpoint


### Secrets

* None inherently; its importance is symbolic


### Persistent Changes

* A peaceful festival strengthens communal bonds
* A bloody festival becomes a shared trauma

NPC behavior in later scenes should reflect this memory.


## Glassworks

### Narrative Function

The first sign that the threat is *targeted* rather than random.


### Core Truths

* The Glassworks is economically important
* Its sabotage indicates planning and intent


### Secrets

* The attack is orchestrated, not opportunistic
* It ties goblin actions to internal Sandpoint vulnerabilities


### Persistent Changes

* Damage affects Sandpoint’s economy
* Surviving witnesses become recurring sources of information or fear


## Catacombs of Wrath

### Narrative Function

Reveal Sandpoint’s hidden foundations and introduce ancient evil in a confined, intimate way.


### Core Truths

* The catacombs predate modern Sandpoint
* They were designed with ritual intent


### Secrets

* Thassilonian runes and symbology
* Evidence of long-dormant but active magic


### Persistent Changes

* Cleansing reduces unseen corruption
* Neglect allows subtle influence to continue


## Thistletop

### Narrative Function

Shift the campaign from defense to intervention.


### Core Truths

* Thistletop is a fortified goblin stronghold
* Goblins here operate under guidance


### Secrets

* The presence of a Runewell
* Nualia’s leadership and transformation


### Persistent Changes

* Destruction disrupts goblin coordination
* Abandonment allows threats to resurface later


## The Runewell of Wrath

### Narrative Function

The first tangible artifact of Runelord-era power encountered by the PCs. It is ancient, dangerous, and partially active.


### Core Truths

* The Runewell stores and channels emotional energy (specifically wrath and anger)
* It is functional, not merely symbolic
* It predates modern Sandpoint and shows Thassilonian design and runes


### Mechanical Specifics

**Location:** Beneath Thistletop, in a sealed chamber approximately 40 feet below ground level

**Access DC:** Perception DC 18 to notice the sealed chamber entrance (mundane stone door with ancient mechanism, requires Disable Device DC 20 to open without triggering trap)

**Chamber Size:** Approximately 30x30 feet, 15 feet high

**Triggers:** The Runewell activates when exposed to **strong emotion matching wrath** - specifically:
* Violent/angry actions within 30 feet
* Combat occurring in the chamber
* An angry creature (with Chaotic Neutral or Chaotic Evil alignment) standing within 10 feet

**Activation Effect:** When triggered, the Runewell:
* Emanates visible purple/crimson runes along its surface (30-foot radius)
* Forces all creatures within 30 feet to make a DC 16 Will save or take a penalty:
  - On failed save: -2 penalty to Perception and Acrobatics for 1 minute (promotes reckless action)
  - On successful save: No effect
* Emits an audible low hum that attracts attention from adjacent areas (goblins, creatures)

**Mechanics for Interaction:**

| Action | DC / Save | Effect |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Knowledge (planes/religion) check to understand purpose | DC 18 | Success identifies it as Thassilonian artifact; can deduce it harvests emotional energy |
| Destroy with mundane damage | - | Runewell shatters, but residual magic lingers (see Persistent Effects) |
| Attempt to disable/neutralize with dispel magic | DC 16/CL 12 | Success temporarily suppresses activity for 24 hours; full neutralization requires more powerful ritual |
| Desecrate or cleanse with holy/profane ritual | - | Alignedclerics can attempt removing corruption (requires 1 hour ritual, DC 20 Religion check) |
| Accidentally damage while fighting near it | Varied | Releases uncontrolled energy burst (see Persistent Effects) |

**Persistent Effects (If Poorly Handled):**

If the Runewell is smashed, desecrated, or carelessly disturbed (rather than properly neutralized):

* **1d4+1 days:** Thistletop area and surrounding 500-foot radius experiences "resonance"
  - Illusions of ancient combat appear at dusk
  - Animals avoid the area
  - Creatures experience nightmares and emotional disturbance  
* **Mechanical resonance:** Any living creature sleeping within 500 feet must make a DC 14 Will save or gain 1d6 nonlethal damage from psychic backlash (damage represents exhaustion and nightmares, not physical harm)
* **NPC effects:** Sandpoint citizens report vivid anger-dreams for 2d4 days; **add +1 to Pressure track per day** until effect fades
* **Book II echo:** Runewell magic influences later Book II events related to wrath/corruption themes

**How to Properly Neutralize:**

* Option 1: Perform a *dispel magic* (CL 12+) ritual focused on the structure (1 hour, DC 20 Spellcraft to properly execute)
* Option 2: A **Chaotic Good or Neutral Good aligned cleric** can consecrate the chamber with a *consecrate* spell cast over the Runewell (1 hour ritual, blocks evil influence but doesn't destroy the structure)
* Option 3: Destroy it AND cast *protection from evil* circle around the destruction site to contain the magic release

**Secrets the Runewell Holds (Not revealed without research):**

* Runes on the structure are Thassilonian (readable with *read magic* and Knowledge planes DC 20)
* The runes reference a sin-lord named **Karzoug** (setting up Book III)
* Energy the well harvests "feeds" something distant (not fully explained in Book I)

**Persistent Changes (Record in EMERGENT_CANON.md):**

* **If destroyed carelessly:** Magic lingers for 2d4 days (see above)
* **If neutralized:**Thistletop becomes "clean" but the ruins still exist; later books don't inherit wrath corruption
* **If left untouched:** Magic intensifies; by Book II, the Runewell actively attracts wrath-aligned creatures and cultists


The Runewell should never feel fully understood at this stage, but its mechanics must be clear so AI adjudicates encounters consistently.
