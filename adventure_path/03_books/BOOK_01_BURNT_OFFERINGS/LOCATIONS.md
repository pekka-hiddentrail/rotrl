# Book I – Burnt Offerings

## Locations

This document defines **narrative-significant locations** in Burnt Offerings. These entries do not describe room-by-room layouts or tactical maps. Instead, they define *purpose, secrets, and persistent consequences*.

Locations are expected to **change state** based on player action or inaction. Once changed, those states should be recorded in emergent canon and respected in later books.


## Sandpoint

### Narrative Function

Sandpoint is the emotional center of the early campaign. It represents normalcy, community, and something worth protecting.

Sandpoint is not static—it reacts to fear, heroism, neglect, and loss.


### Core Truths

* Sandpoint is young, ambitious, and fragile
* It is built atop older, partially forgotten ruins
* Authority is limited; leadership relies on trust


### Secrets

* Beneath Sandpoint lie remnants of Thassilonian structures
* These ruins subtly influence events above

These secrets need not be fully uncovered in this book.


### Persistent Changes

Possible long-term outcomes include:

* Increased civic trust in the PCs
* Lingering fear or paranoia
* Structural or population damage

Later books should reflect Sandpoint’s accumulated scars.


## Swallowtail Festival Grounds

### Narrative Function

A symbol of unity, tradition, and joy—used to contrast sharply with sudden violence.


### Core Truths

* The festival is public, crowded, and vulnerable
* It serves as a social cross-section of Sandpoint


### Secrets

* None inherently; its importance is symbolic


### Persistent Changes

* A peaceful festival strengthens communal bonds
* A bloody festival becomes a shared trauma

NPC behavior in later scenes should reflect this memory.


## Glassworks

### Narrative Function

The first sign that the threat is *targeted* rather than random.


### Core Truths

* The Glassworks is economically important
* Its sabotage indicates planning and intent


### Secrets

* The attack is orchestrated, not opportunistic
* It ties goblin actions to internal Sandpoint vulnerabilities


### Persistent Changes

* Damage affects Sandpoint’s economy
* Surviving witnesses become recurring sources of information or fear


## Catacombs of Wrath

### Narrative Function

Reveal Sandpoint’s hidden foundations and introduce ancient evil in a confined, intimate way.


### Core Truths

* The catacombs predate modern Sandpoint
* They were designed with ritual intent


### Secrets

* Thassilonian runes and symbology
* Evidence of long-dormant but active magic


### Persistent Changes

* Cleansing reduces unseen corruption
* Neglect allows subtle influence to continue


## Thistletop

### Narrative Function

Shift the campaign from defense to intervention.


### Core Truths

* Thistletop is a fortified goblin stronghold
* Goblins here operate under guidance


### Secrets

* The presence of a Runewell
* Nualia’s leadership and transformation


### Persistent Changes

* Destruction disrupts goblin coordination
* Abandonment allows threats to resurface later


## The Runewell of Wrath

### Narrative Function

The first tangible artifact of Runelord-era power encountered by the PCs.


### Core Truths

* The Runewell stores and channels emotional energy
* It is functional, not merely symbolic


### Secrets

* It responds to specific emotional states
* Its purpose extends beyond this region


### Persistent Changes

* Improper handling leaves lingering magical effects
* Its disturbance echoes forward into later books

The Runewell should never feel fully understood at this stage.
