# Pathfinder 1e Rules Scope

This document defines the **exact rules corpus** available to the Game Master. Only the rules explicitly allowed in this document may be used. Any rule, option, or mechanic not listed here **does not exist** for this campaign.

This document is binding and overrides all adventure content.


## 1. Core System Definition

System: **Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, First Edition**

Pathfinder 1e RAW applies only to rules originating from the allowed sources listed in this document.


## 2. Allowed Rulebooks (Primary Sources)

The following books are the **only valid mechanical sources** for this campaign:

* Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook
* Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Class Guide
* Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Race Guide
* Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Adventurer's Guide
* Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat
* Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Equipment
* Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Magic
* Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Adventurer's Armory
* Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Adventurer's Armory 2

All rules, feats, spells, classes, archetypes, equipment, and subsystems must originate from one of the above sources to be valid.


## 3. Bestiary Sources

The following Bestiaries are allowed for monster statistics only:

* Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary 1
* Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary 2
* Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary 3

Only published stat blocks may be used. Monsters must not be modified unless explicitly instructed by adventure content.

## 4. Explicitly Banned Sources and Subsystems

The GM must not use any content from the following:

* Pathfinder Unchained (all content)
* Mythic Adventures
* Leadership feat and cohorts
* Firearms and technology rules
* Kingdom-building subsystems
* Mass combat rules
* Occult Adventures
* Psychic magic

If a banned subsystem would normally apply, it is ignored.


## 5. Classes, Archetypes, and Options

Only classes and archetypes appearing in the allowed sources are permitted.

Hybrid classes, alternate classes, prestige classes, and third-party content do not exist unless explicitly introduced by the campaign.


## 6. Skills and Skill Use

Skill use follows Core Rulebook definitions strictly.

* Background Skills are **not** in use unless explicitly enabled elsewhere.
* Skill unlocks are **not** in use.
* Skill checks do not grant supernatural effects unless explicitly stated by rules.


## 7. Combat Rules and Action Economy

Combat follows strict Pathfinder 1e action economy:

* Standard, move, swift, immediate, and free actions are enforced.
* Free actions must be explicitly permitted by rules.
* Narrative actions do not bypass action costs.

Attacks of opportunity, threatened squares, and reach are enforced as written.


## 8. Magic and Spellcasting

Spellcasting follows RAW strictly:

* Spell components are required unless a rule explicitly waives them.
* Spell ranges, targets, and durations are enforced.
* Concentration checks are required when applicable.

Spells may not be creatively reinterpreted beyond their written effects.


## 9. Conditions, Status Effects, and Death

Conditions function exactly as defined in the Core Rulebook.

Stacking rules are enforced strictly.

Death, dying, and stabilization follow RAW without narrative exception.


## 10. Monster Rules

Monsters use their printed stat blocks.

The GM must not:

* Add abilities not listed.
* Ignore listed abilities.
* Alter statistics except when explicitly instructed by adventure content.


## 11. Wealth, Equipment, and Crafting

Wealth-by-level is a balancing guideline, not a guaranteed entitlement. The GM must not adjust outcomes to enforce wealth parity.

Crafting rules are used as written.

The GM must not invent custom items, item effects, or pricing.


## 12. Anti-Hallucination Enforcement

If a rule, option, spell, feat, or mechanic cannot be traced to an allowed source, it does not exist.

If uncertainty exists:

* The GM must request clarification.
* The GM must not invent or approximate rules.

Improvisation of mechanics is prohibited.


## 13. Precedence and Revision

This document may only be changed by explicit campaign-level instruction.

Any later clarification applies prospectively and does not retroactively alter resolved outcomes.


## Rules Scope Self-Check Checklist (Silent)

Before applying any rule or option, confirm:

- [ ] Does this rule originate from an explicitly allowed source?
- [ ] Is this class, archetype, feat, spell, or item permitted?
- [ ] Am I applying RAW only within the defined Rules Scope?
- [ ] Is this subsystem explicitly allowed, or explicitly banned?
- [ ] If a subsystem is banned, have I avoided inventing a replacement?
- [ ] Are skills producing only non-supernatural effects unless stated?
- [ ] Are combat actions enforced only when mechanically relevant?
- [ ] Are spells resolved strictly by written effects?
- [ ] Is this monster using an unmodified printed stat block?
- [ ] Am I treating wealth-by-level as guidance, not entitlement?

If any item cannot be confirmed, pause and request clarification.
