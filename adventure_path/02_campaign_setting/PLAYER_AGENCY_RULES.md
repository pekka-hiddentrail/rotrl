# Player Agency Rules

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This file defines the **bounds, guarantees, and constraints of player agency** within this campaign.

It exists to:

* Protect meaningful choice without dissolving structure
* Prevent railroading *and* narrative escape exploits
* Clarify what players can change versus what they must confront

Player agency is real, but it is not absolute.


## 2. Agency Philosophy

This campaign follows a **constrained agency model**:

* Players choose *how* events unfold
* Players influence *outcomes and consequences*
* Players do not choose *whether the campaign exists*

The world responds to player action, but it does not pause, dissolve, or rewrite itself to accommodate avoidance.


## 3. Guaranteed Player Freedoms

Players are always free to:

* Choose approaches to problems
* Form, break, or ignore alliances
* Delay objectives (with consequences)
* Retreat from overwhelming danger
* Fail without ending the campaign

No single solution is required for progression.


## 4. Explicit Agency Constraints

Players may not:

* Opt out of the campaign’s core conflict without consequence
* Solve long-arc threats through isolated or off-genre actions
* Permanently bypass campaign stakes via logistics, wealth, or meta-knowledge
* Rewrite established world physics or metaphysics

Avoidance is treated as a choice, not an escape.


## 5. Consequence Model

All meaningful actions produce consequences.

* Immediate consequences affect scenes
* Short-term consequences affect locations and NPCs
* Long-term consequences affect factions and threats

Consequences may be:

* Beneficial
* Neutral
* Harmful

The absence of consequence is itself a consequence.


## 6. Failure Handling

Failure is valid and expected.

* Failed objectives do not end the campaign
* Failure reshapes the situation rather than negating progress
* Some failures permanently close options

Recovery is possible, but not guaranteed.


## 7. Agency vs Power Scaling

As player power increases:

* Tactical freedom increases
* Strategic responsibility increases
* Moral ambiguity increases

High-level agency comes with systemic consequences rather than simple success.


## 8. NPC and World Resistance

The world resists simplification.

* Institutions push back
* Factions adapt
* NPCs protect their interests

The world is not obligated to be fair, only consistent.


## 9. Meta-Protection Rules

To preserve agency integrity:

* Do not nullify player plans arbitrarily
* Do not force outcomes without player input
* Do not protect players from the results of informed choices

Transparency is preferred over surprise negation.


## 10. Agency Resolution Principle

When uncertain:

> Favor player choice **unless** it would eliminate long-arc threats, contradict established canon, or trivialize future play.


## 11. Priority Note

This document governs campaign-specific agency boundaries, but does not override system authority, adjudication principles, or combat mechanics.
