# NPC Memory and Continuity

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This file defines how **non-player characters persist, remember, and change** over the course of the campaign.

It exists to:

* Prevent NPC drift and replacement
* Ensure social consequences accumulate
* Maintain the illusion of a living world

NPCs are not disposable scene props. They are ongoing participants in the campaign.


## 2. NPC Identity Rules

### 2.1 Named NPC Persistence

* Once an NPC is named, they persist unless explicitly removed from play
* Named NPCs should be reused when returning to a location
* Do not invent a replacement NPC if an existing one logically fills the role

**Instruction:** Reuse before inventing.


### 2.2 Unnamed NPCs

* Unnamed NPCs may be created freely
* If an unnamed NPC becomes narratively important, they should be named
* Once named, they are subject to persistence rules


## 3. NPC Memory Model

NPCs remember:

* How the PCs treated them
* Outcomes that affected their safety, livelihood, or reputation
* Public events they plausibly witnessed or heard about

NPCs do not have perfect recall. Memory is:

* Subjective
* Incomplete
* Influenced by bias and rumor

**Instruction:** NPC memory should feel human, not archival.


## 4. Reputation and Social Consequences

NPC reactions are influenced by:

* Local reputation of the PCs
* Personal history with the PCs
* Faction allegiance

Reputation spreads unevenly:

* Faster in small communities
* Slower and distorted in cities

NPCs may:

* Withhold help
* Offer aid unprompted
* Change tone without explanation


## 5. NPC Competence Boundaries

NPCs have realistic limits.

* Guards are not adventurers
* Experts excel only in their domain
* Authority figures are constrained by politics and fear

NPCs should not solve problems meant for the PCs.


## 6. NPC Change Over Time

NPCs evolve due to:

* Trauma
* Success or failure
* Prolonged fear or hope

Changes should be:

* Gradual
* Visible in behavior rather than exposition

NPCs may grow braver, colder, more cautious, or more desperate.


## 7. Death, Removal, and Absence

* NPC death is permanent unless extraordinary intervention occurs
* Removing an NPC creates a vacuum, not a replacement
* Vacuums attract conflict, instability, or decline

Do not automatically promote a new NPC to fill a lost role.


## 8. NPCs and Player Failure

NPCs react to PC failure.

* Trust may erode
* Fear may turn into resentment
* Allies may withdraw support

NPCs do not exist to reassure the PCs.


## 9. Off-Screen NPC Behavior

NPCs continue acting off-screen within their means.

* They pursue safety
* They protect loved ones
* They avoid obvious danger

Off-screen actions should:

* Align with established personality
* Create consequences, not solutions


## 10. Priority Note

This document governs narrative continuity and social realism, but does not override adjudication rules, combat mechanics, or player agency constraints.
