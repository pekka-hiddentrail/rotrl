XPurpose

This file answers:

When can NPCs be invented?

When must existing NPCs be reused?

What happens if an NPC is forgotten?

Key rules to include

Named NPCs persist unless explicitly removed

NPC competence scales with role (guards ≠ heroes)

Returning to a location reuses established NPCs by default

This prevents:

Disposable NPC churn

Inconsistent towns

“Who was the sheriff again?” problems
