# NPC Memory and Continuity

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This file defines how **non-player characters persist, remember, and change** over the course of the campaign.

It exists to:

* Prevent NPC drift and replacement
* Ensure social consequences accumulate
* Maintain the illusion of a living world

NPCs are not disposable scene props. They are ongoing participants in the campaign.


## 2. NPC Identity Rules

### 2.1 Named NPC Persistence

* Once an NPC is named, they persist unless explicitly removed from play
* Named NPCs should be reused when returning to a location
* Do not invent a replacement NPC if an existing one logically fills the role

**Instruction:** Reuse before inventing.


### 2.2 Unnamed NPCs

* Unnamed NPCs may be created freely
* If an unnamed NPC becomes narratively important, they should be named
* Once named, they are subject to persistence rules


## 3. NPC Memory Model

NPCs remember specific things accurately but interpret them through bias.

### What NPCs Remember EXACTLY:

* **Direct dialogue:** Word-for-word speech from PCs or other NPCs (record in session notes)
* **Explicit actions:** "You burned down the tavern" or "You gave me 100 gold"
* **Public events:** Festival attack, someone's death, visible destruction
* **Canon facts:** Named NPCs' names, town locations, established facts

**NPCs do NOT forget these things, and cannot contradict them.**

### What NPCs Remember INCOMPLETELY:

* Hidden PC motivations (they guess or assume)
* Details they didn't directly witness
* Conversations they weren't part of
* Reasons behind events

**NPCs may be mistaken about WHY something happened, but not about THAT it happened.**

### What NPCs' Bias AFFECTS:

* **Interpretation:** "You're a hero" vs "You're reckless"
* **Trust level:** "You saved me, so you're trustworthy" vs "You helped, but I still don't know you"
* **Assumption about future:** "You'll help again" vs "You might abandon us"
* **Emotional tone:** Grateful, resentful, suspicious, hopeful (same facts, different feelings)

**Bias changes HOW NPCs feel about facts, not what the facts are.**

### Memory Rules

* **Fact Memory:** Accurate and unchanging (canon facts + session facts)
* **Emotional Memory:** Colored by NPC personality and past treatment (can change with new evidence)
* **Rumor Memory:** What they heard third-hand is always fuzzy and may be wrong

**Example:**

```
FACT: PC burned the Glassworks
NPC Completion: Yes, Ameiko saw it.

INTERPRETATION #1 (Grateful NPC):
"You defeated the arsonists! You saved Sandpoint!"

INTERPRETATION #2 (Suspicious NPC):
"You burned his own business down. Why? Insurance? Cover-up?"

BIAS: Both remember the same fact; they interpret it differently.

CANNOT HAPPEN:
NPC saying "No, the Glassworks was never burned" (that contradicts session facts)
```

### Recording Memory

All NPC-relevant facts **must be recorded in SESSION_NOTES_PROTOCOL.md** so that:
1. Facts remain consistent across sessions
2. Bias and interpretation can vary, but underlying facts don't change
3. Later sessions reference the same facts, not invented memories

**Instruction:** NPC memory should feel human—biased and emotional—but record facts in session notes.


### Authority Note: Memory vs State

This document defines **how NPCs remember and interpret events**.

It does not itself change NPC state.

All persistent changes to:
- NPC existence
- Relationships
- Psychological or narrative state

must be recorded in **NPC_STATE_LOG_TEMPLATE.md** and referenced by
**SESSION_NOTES_PROTOCOL.md**.

If a change is not logged, it is not canon.



## 4. Reputation and Social Consequences

NPC reactions are influenced by:

* Local reputation of the PCs
* Personal history with the PCs
* Faction allegiance

Reputation spreads unevenly:

* Faster in small communities
* Slower and distorted in cities

NPCs may:

* Withhold help
* Offer aid unprompted
* Change tone without explanation


## 5. NPC Competence Boundaries

NPCs have realistic limits.

* Guards are not adventurers
* Experts excel only in their domain
* Authority figures are constrained by politics and fear

NPCs should not solve problems meant for the PCs.


## 6. NPC Change Over Time

NPCs evolve **only when change is demonstrated on-screen or logged as a state change** due to:

* Trauma
* Success or failure
* Prolonged fear or hope

Changes should be:

* Gradual
* Visible in behavior rather than exposition

NPCs may grow braver, colder, more cautious, or more desperate. Gradual change must still be evidenced by specific events and logged when it becomes persistent.


## 7. Death, Removal, and Absence

* NPC death is permanent unless extraordinary intervention occurs
* Removing an NPC creates a vacuum, not a replacement
* Vacuums attract conflict, instability, or decline

Do not automatically promote a new NPC to fill a lost role.


## 8. NPCs and Player Failure

NPCs react to PC failure.

* Trust may erode
* Fear may turn into resentment
* Allies may withdraw support

NPCs do not exist to reassure the PCs.


## 9. Off-Screen NPC Behavior

NPCs continue acting off-screen within their means.

* They pursue safety
* They protect loved ones
* They avoid obvious danger

Off-screen actions should:

* Align with established personality
* Create consequences, not solutions


## 10. Priority Note

This document governs narrative continuity and social realism, but does not override adjudication rules, combat mechanics, or player agency constraints.
