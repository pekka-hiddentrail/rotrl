# Campaign Overview — Rise of the Runelords

## 1. Campaign Identity

**Campaign Name:** Rise of the Runelords
**System:** Pathfinder 1st Edition
**Primary Setting:** Varisia (Lost Coast, Storval Plateau, Kodar Mountains)
**Campaign Type:** Long-form, level-spanning Adventure Path with structured escalation

This campaign is a narrative-driven adventure focused on uncovering and opposing the return of ancient Thassilonian powers. It blends local heroism, investigation, horror, wilderness survival, and high-level mythic confrontation.


## 2. Campaign Scope and Boundaries

### 2.1 Geographic Scope

The campaign is geographically constrained to **Varisia and immediately adjacent regions explicitly referenced in the Adventure Path**. Travel beyond these regions is discouraged unless directly prompted by player action and explicitly adjudicated by the GM.

The campaign assumes:

* Dense ruins of ancient Thassilonian origin
* Dangerous wilderness between settlements
* Limited rapid travel until higher levels

### 2.2 Narrative Scope

The campaign covers the full arc from **local threats** to **world-altering ancient evils**, escalating in scale, stakes, and knowledge.

The story is not a sandbox in the global sense; it is a **guided narrative with meaningful local agency**.

Players may:

* Alter outcomes of towns, NPCs, and factions
* Choose methods, alliances, and priorities
* Delay or accelerate certain events

Players may not:

* Prevent the existence of the core threats
* Escape the campaign by abandoning Varisia without consequence
* Nullify the long arc through off-genre solutions


## 3. Campaign Structure (High-Level)

The campaign progresses through **six major narrative phases**, each redefining player understanding of the world.

### Phase I — Local Defenders

**Levels:** 1–3
**Focus:** Survival, trust, and local heroism

* Threats appear small, chaotic, and disconnected
* PCs establish roots in the setting (especially Sandpoint)
* Tone: grounded, slightly whimsical, danger without full context

### Phase II — Hidden Patterns

**Levels:** 4–6
**Focus:** Investigation, horror, and revelation

* Threats gain intelligence and intent
* Recurring symbols and themes emerge (sin, greed, runes)
* PCs begin uncovering conspiracies

### Phase III — Regional Crisis

**Levels:** 7–10
**Focus:** Warfare, leadership, and consequence

* Threats scale to regional devastation
* PCs are no longer anonymous adventurers
* Failures and successes have visible consequences

### Phase IV — Ancient Truths

**Levels:** 11–13
**Focus:** Lore mastery and moral pressure

* PCs confront remnants of Thassilon directly
* Moral compromises and dangerous knowledge appear
* Tone shifts toward grim inevitability

### Phase V — Mythic Opposition

**Levels:** 14–15
**Focus:** Preparation against an inevitable confrontation

* PCs actively work to undo ancient protections
* Enemies are no longer merely monsters but institutions and legacies

### Phase VI — Final Reckoning

**Levels:** 16+
**Focus:** Resolution, sacrifice, and legacy

* Direct confrontation with the central antagonist
* The campaign resolves with permanent world impact


## 4. Central Themes

The campaign consistently reinforces the following themes:

* **The cost of ancient power** — Great achievements leave scars
* **Sin as structure, not impulse** — Evil is organized, patient, and systemic
* **Legacy and responsibility** — What survives us matters
* **Local choices, global consequences** — Small acts echo forward

These themes should subtly influence descriptions, NPC motivations, and consequences.


## 5. Player Agency Philosophy

Player agency is strongest in:

* How problems are solved
* Which NPCs survive or fall
* What alliances are formed or broken
* The order and manner of engagement

Player agency is constrained in:

* The existence of the long arc threat
* The metaphysical rules of the world
* The historical reality of Thassilon

The campaign rewards **engagement, preparation, and curiosity**, not avoidance.


## 6. Failure, Consequences, and Recovery

Failure is permitted and meaningful.

* NPC deaths are permanent unless explicitly reversed by extraordinary means
* Towns can suffer lasting harm
* Information may be lost

However:

* Failure does not end the campaign
* The story adapts rather than collapses

The campaign assumes resilience, not perfection.


## 7. GM Instruction Summary

When running this campaign:

* Treat early threats as real, not disposable
* Reinforce continuity and memory
* Escalate tone gradually
* Do not reveal the full scope early
* Let players feel the weight of history before naming it

This overview defines **what kind of story this is**, not how each scene unfolds.
