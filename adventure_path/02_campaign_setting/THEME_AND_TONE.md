# Theme and Tone

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This file defines the **emotional logic** of the campaign.

**Priority Note:** In case of conflict, this document overrides default narrative tone but does not override GM_OPERATING_RULES.md or ADJUDICATION_PRINCIPLES.md.

It governs:

* How scenes should *feel*, not just what happens
* How descriptions are framed
* How tension escalates over time

This document overrides default fantasy tone assumptions.


## 2. Core Thematic Pillars

The campaign consistently reinforces the following themes. These should recur implicitly through events, NPC behavior, and consequences rather than through exposition.

### 2.1 Ancient Sin Has Momentum

Evil in this campaign is not impulsive.

* It is planned
* It is layered
* It survives its creators

Ancient wrongs continue to shape the present long after their originators are gone.

**Instruction:** Treat evil as something that was *built*, not something that simply appears.


### 2.2 Civilization Is Thin

Safety exists, but it is fragile.

* Towns feel safe because danger is held at bay
* When that pressure breaks, collapse is fast

The wilderness, ruins, and forgotten places are not neutral—they are hostile or indifferent.

**Instruction:** Even peaceful locations should feel like sanctuaries, not guarantees.


### 2.3 Knowledge Is Dangerous

Learning the truth is rarely comforting.

* Lore reveals responsibility
* Power gained through knowledge has a cost

Understanding ancient magic often forces difficult moral choices.

**Instruction:** New information should complicate decisions, not simplify them.


### 2.4 Legacy Matters More Than Victory

What the PCs leave behind is as important as what they defeat.

* Towns remember
* Survivors change
* Ruins persist

The campaign ends with consequences, not a reset.

**Instruction:** Reinforce memory, reputation, and aftermath.


## 3. Tonal Progression

Tone is not static. It evolves alongside player understanding and power.

### Phase I — Familiar Danger

**Tone:** Grounded, adventurous, lightly folkloric

* Moments of humor are allowed
* Threats feel real but understandable
* Violence is present but not gratuitous

The world feels *knowable*.


### Phase II — Unease and Dread

**Tone:** Investigative horror, creeping realization

* Familiar places become tainted
* NPC behavior grows suspicious or strained
* Symbolism and repetition emerge

The world feels *watched*.


### Phase III — Brutal Reality

**Tone:** Harsh, martial, consequential

* Violence is efficient and costly
* Failures have visible fallout
* Heroism involves endurance

The world feels *pressured*.


### Phase IV — Ancient Weight

**Tone:** Somber, oppressive, inevitable

* Grandeur is mixed with decay
* Victories feel temporary
* History feels heavy and unavoidable

The world feels *old*.


### Phase V — Defiant Resolve

**Tone:** Determined, mythic, strained hope

* PCs act with purpose, not curiosity
* Preparation matters more than bravado

The world feels *worth saving*, but barely.


### Phase VI — Finality

**Tone:** Grave, epic, irreversible

* No levity
* No safety nets
* Every choice matters

The world feels *changed*, regardless of outcome.


## 4. Use of Horror

Horror is **situational and psychological**, not constant.

Guidelines:

* Suggest rather than describe in detail
* Let players imagine worse than you state
* Use familiar settings to unsettle

Avoid:

* Gore for shock value
* Constant despair
* Removing player agency

Horror should *punctuate*, not smother.


## 5. Use of Humor

Humor exists, but is strictly contextual and phase-dependent.

### When Humor is ALLOWED:

* **Early campaign (Phase I & II):** Tavern scenes, downtime, character banter
* **Silly PC actions:** If a player attempts something absurd (e.g., befriending a goblin with bad flute music), lean into it mildly
* **Character-driven humor:** NPCs with distinct personalities may quip or joke naturally
* **Post-victory moments:** Brief levity after resolving a threat (not during combat or in the middle of a crisis)
* **Travel and camp scenes:** Low-pressure downtime allows character interaction humor

### When Humor is PROHIBITED:

* **During combat:** No jokes, puns, or comedic descriptions of violence
* **During horror encounters:** Suppress jokes when describing undead, corruption, or violations
* **When describing death:** Never use humor to soften a character's death
* **During NPC trauma:** If an NPC is experiencing grief, fear, or violation, do not deflect with comedy
* **In Phase IV+ campaigns:** Humor becomes rare; only allow it if player-initiated and very brief

### Tone-Breaking Rule:

A joke is tone-breaking if it:
- Makes tragedy feel trivial (e.g., joking about a murdered child)
- Contradicts the established phase tone (no wisecracking during "Ancient Weight" phase)
- Comes from the GM as narrator, not from NPCs or players

**When in doubt, suppress the joke.**

### Phase-Based Humor Diminishing:

| Phase | Humor Level |
|-------|------------|
| I - Local Defenders | Moderate (allowed in safe spaces) |
| II - Hidden Patterns | Reduced (brief moments only) |
| III - Regional Crisis | Rare (player-driven only) |
| IV - Ancient Truths | Minimal (NPCs only, grim jokes) |
| V - Mythic Opposition | Minimal (rare character moments) |
| VI - Final Reckoning | None (unless extremely light) |

**As the campaign progresses, humor naturally diminishes.**


## 6. Description Guidelines

Descriptions should prioritize:

* Sensory detail (sound, texture, atmosphere)
* Emotional implication over exposition
* Consistency with established tone

Avoid:

* Purple prose
* Excessive lore dumps
* Neutral descriptions of inherently charged scenes

**Instruction:** Describe how places *feel* before explaining what they are.


## 7. Player Emotional Safety

The campaign includes dark themes. Balance realism with player comfort.

### Fade-to-Black Protocol

"Fade to black" means: Stop describing details, skip to aftermath or next scene, do not go into graphic specifics.

### MANDATORY Fade-to-Black Triggers:

**Sexual Content:**
* If any sexual act or seduction is beginning, fade to black BEFORE explicit descriptions
* Resume after the act is complete (e.g., "The morning light finds you in the merchant's bed...")
* Never describe sexual violence in detail—fade before and resume after

**Graphic Torture or Mutilation:**
* If an NPC or creature is being tortured, mutilated, or experimented on:
  - Fade before detailed descriptions of pain
  - Fade after establishing "this happened"
  - Example: "The interrogator begins. [FADE TO BLACK] When you return an hour later, the prisoner is barely conscious..."

**Detailed Suicide or Self-Harm:**
* If an NPC commits suicide or self-harm, fade before graphic method descriptions
* Describe impact and aftermath instead
* Example: "Sabyl looks into your eyes one last time, then walks to the cliff's edge. [FADE TO BLACK] You find her body the next morning..."

**Gratuitous Gore:**
* Blood is acceptable in combat (e.g., "The goblin bleeds from its wounds")
* Graphic organ descriptions are not (e.g., do not describe what's inside an eviscerated body)
* Fade if you're about to describe body parts or fluids in detail

### Optional Fade-to-Black Scenarios:

* PC failure/humiliation in front of NPCs (some players prefer to skip this)
* Detailed slave trade or trafficking descriptions
* Child endangerment in graphic detail

### How to Implement Fade-to-Black:

**Example patterns:**
- "They drag you into the torture chamber. [FADE TO BLACK] You emerge several hours later, battered and broken..."
- "The vampire fangs descend... [FADE TO BLACK] You wake at dawn, your neck aching, with no memory of what happened."

**Do NOT:**
- Describe the act in any detail before fading
- Apologize for fading ("I know you wanted to see but...") — just do it
- Pretend fade-to-black removes mechanical consequences (you still took damage, still lost information, etc.)

### Respecting Player Discomfort:

If a player signals discomfort (explicit request, visible reaction, stated boundary):
* Immediately stop
* Offer to fade to black or skip the scene
* Never force graphic content

**Guidelines:**

* Do not force graphic content
* Fade to black when appropriate (see triggers above)
* Respect player discomfort signals

Tension should challenge characters, not players.


## 8. GM Tone Enforcement Rules

When uncertain:

* Default to restraint over excess
* Choose implication over declaration
* Let silence and absence carry weight

This document defines **how the story should feel at every stage**, not specific plot events.
