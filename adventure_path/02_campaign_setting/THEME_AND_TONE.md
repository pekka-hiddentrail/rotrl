# Theme and Tone

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This file defines the **emotional logic** of the campaign.

**Priority Note:** In case of conflict, this document overrides default narrative tone but does not override GM_OPERATING_RULES.md or ADJUDICATION_PRINCIPLES.md.

It governs:

* How scenes should *feel*, not just what happens
* How descriptions are framed
* How tension escalates over time

This document overrides default fantasy tone assumptions.


## 2. Core Thematic Pillars

The campaign consistently reinforces the following themes. These should recur implicitly through events, NPC behavior, and consequences rather than through exposition.

### 2.1 Ancient Sin Has Momentum

Evil in this campaign is not impulsive.

* It is planned
* It is layered
* It survives its creators

Ancient wrongs continue to shape the present long after their originators are gone.

**Instruction:** Treat evil as something that was *built*, not something that simply appears.


### 2.2 Civilization Is Thin

Safety exists, but it is fragile.

* Towns feel safe because danger is held at bay
* When that pressure breaks, collapse is fast

The wilderness, ruins, and forgotten places are not neutral—they are hostile or indifferent.

**Instruction:** Even peaceful locations should feel like sanctuaries, not guarantees.


### 2.3 Knowledge Is Dangerous

Learning the truth is rarely comforting.

* Lore reveals responsibility
* Power gained through knowledge has a cost

Understanding ancient magic often forces difficult moral choices.

**Instruction:** New information should complicate decisions, not simplify them.


### 2.4 Legacy Matters More Than Victory

What the PCs leave behind is as important as what they defeat.

* Towns remember
* Survivors change
* Ruins persist

The campaign ends with consequences, not a reset.

**Instruction:** Reinforce memory, reputation, and aftermath.


## 3. Tonal Progression

Tone is not static. It evolves alongside player understanding and power.

### Phase I — Familiar Danger

**Tone:** Grounded, adventurous, lightly folkloric

* Moments of humor are allowed
* Threats feel real but understandable
* Violence is present but not gratuitous

The world feels *knowable*.


### Phase II — Unease and Dread

**Tone:** Investigative horror, creeping realization

* Familiar places become tainted
* NPC behavior grows suspicious or strained
* Symbolism and repetition emerge

The world feels *watched*.


### Phase III — Brutal Reality

**Tone:** Harsh, martial, consequential

* Violence is efficient and costly
* Failures have visible fallout
* Heroism involves endurance

The world feels *pressured*.


### Phase IV — Ancient Weight

**Tone:** Somber, oppressive, inevitable

* Grandeur is mixed with decay
* Victories feel temporary
* History feels heavy and unavoidable

The world feels *old*.


### Phase V — Defiant Resolve

**Tone:** Determined, mythic, strained hope

* PCs act with purpose, not curiosity
* Preparation matters more than bravado

The world feels *worth saving*, but barely.


### Phase VI — Finality

**Tone:** Grave, epic, irreversible

* No levity
* No safety nets
* Every choice matters

The world feels *changed*, regardless of outcome.


## 4. Use of Horror

Horror is **situational and psychological**, not constant.

Guidelines:

* Suggest rather than describe in detail
* Let players imagine worse than you state
* Use familiar settings to unsettle

Avoid:

* Gore for shock value
* Constant despair
* Removing player agency

Horror should *punctuate*, not smother.


## 5. Use of Humor

Humor exists, but it is contextual.

Allowed:

* Early campaign levity
* Character-driven banter
* Situational absurdity

Discouraged:

* Meta humor
* Tone-breaking jokes during high-stakes scenes
* Comedy that trivializes danger

As the campaign progresses, humor naturally diminishes.


## 6. Description Guidelines

Descriptions should prioritize:

* Sensory detail (sound, texture, atmosphere)
* Emotional implication over exposition
* Consistency with established tone

Avoid:

* Purple prose
* Excessive lore dumps
* Neutral descriptions of inherently charged scenes

**Instruction:** Describe how places *feel* before explaining what they are.


## 7. Player Emotional Safety

The campaign includes dark themes.

Guidelines:

* Do not force graphic content
* Fade to black when appropriate
* Respect player discomfort signals

Tension should challenge characters, not players.


## 8. GM Tone Enforcement Rules

When uncertain:

* Default to restraint over excess
* Choose implication over declaration
* Let silence and absence carry weight

This document defines **how the story should feel at every stage**, not specific plot events.
