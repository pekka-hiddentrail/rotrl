# Factions and Powers

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This file defines the **organized forces** that shape the campaign world.

It exists to:

* Prevent faction sprawl and invention drift
* Ensure recurring actors behave consistently
* Anchor improvisation to existing power structures

Factions are engines of consequence, not background color.


## 2. Faction Design Principles

When portraying factions:

* Treat them as persistent entities with memory
* Assume internal hierarchy and conflicting interests
* Avoid creating new major factions unless explicitly required

**Instruction:** If a new organization is needed, first ask whether an existing faction can logically fill the role.


## 3. Major Campaign Factions

### 3.1 Thassilonian Remnants (Ancient)

**Nature:** Dormant, fragmented, inevitable
**Scope:** Continental, historical, metaphysical

These are not a single organization but the lingering systems, magic, and structures left behind by Thassilon.

Characteristics:

* Ruins that still function imperfectly
* Magic that reflects ancient sins
* Defenses that assume a long-dead worldview

They do not adapt quickly—but they endure.

**Role in Campaign:**

* Primary source of ancient danger
* Framework through which the central antagonist operates


### 3.2 The Runelords (Mythic Antagonists)

**Nature:** Individual, immortal, patient
**Scope:** World-altering

The Runelords are not villains in the traditional sense—they are embodiments of an ancient philosophy of power.

Key Traits:

* Operate through proxies and systems
* Rarely act directly
* Treat mortal lives as resources

Not all Runelords are active, but their influence persists.

**Role in Campaign:**

* Ultimate antagonistic force
* Source of long-arc tension


### 3.3 Giantkind of the Storval Plateau

**Nature:** Militarized, hierarchical, brutal
**Scope:** Regional, expanding

Stone giants and their allies serve as the most visible instruments of ancient will.

Characteristics:

* Strong oral traditions
* Obedience to ancient authority
* Pragmatic cruelty rather than malice

**Role in Campaign:**

* Mid-to-late campaign military threat
* Bridge between ancient evil and present devastation


### 3.4 Lamia Matriarchs and Hidden Cult Networks

**Nature:** Manipulative, secretive, adaptive
**Scope:** Urban and regional

These entities operate beneath civilization, exploiting greed, fear, and ambition.

Characteristics:

* Disguises and false fronts
* Use of cults and corrupted officials
* Reliance on symbols and rituals

**Role in Campaign:**

* Early-to-mid campaign antagonists
* Introduce conspiracy and horror elements


### 3.5 Regional Powers (Civilization)

#### Magnimar

**Nature:** Political, mercantile, divided

* Values profit and influence
* Slow to act without incentive
* Capable of great good or terrible neglect

#### Korvosa

**Nature:** Authoritarian, disciplined, unstable

* Strong rule structures
* Less relevant early, more volatile later

**Role in Campaign:**

* Sources of aid, obstruction, or moral compromise


### 3.6 The Pathfinder Society

**Nature:** Decentralized, pragmatic, curious
**Scope:** Informational, exploratory

The Society seeks knowledge first, safety second.

Characteristics:

* Willing to risk catastrophe for discovery
* Fragmented leadership
* Mixed motives among members

**Role in Campaign:**

* Occasional allies
* Moral foil regarding knowledge vs responsibility


## 4. Minor and Local Factions

Smaller groups exist but should remain:

* Local in scope
* Short-lived unless reinforced
* Tied to larger powers

Examples:

* Town councils
* Mercenary bands
* Local cult cells

**Instruction:** Minor factions should not overshadow major forces.


## 5. Faction Interaction Rules

* Factions pursue goals even off-screen
* Factions remember PC actions
* Alliances are conditional and revocable

Destroying a leader does not necessarily destroy a faction.


## 6. Player Interaction Expectations

Players may:

* Oppose factions directly
* Undermine leadership
* Redirect resources
* Influence public perception

Players may not:

* Instantly dismantle entrenched powers
* Bypass faction logic through isolated victories

Progress against factions is cumulative.


## 7. Escalation Guidance

As the campaign progresses:

* Factions act more openly
* Conflicts grow less deniable
* Stakes shift from local to existential

**Instruction:** Early secrecy gives way to visible war.


## 8. Priority Note

In case of conflict, this document informs narrative consistency and power dynamics but does not override system authority or adjudication rules.
