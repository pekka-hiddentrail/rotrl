# Magic and Metaphysics

## Authority and Purpose

This document defines **Tier 1 truths** about how magic functions in the world and what metaphysical rules govern supernatural effects.

All magic follows **Pathfinder 1E rules as written** unless explicitly modified by *Rise of the Runelords*.

This document exists to prevent soft-magic improvisation, narrative spell effects, and metaphysical drift.


## Fundamental Nature of Magic

* Magic is a **real, structured force** governed by rules
* It is not symbolic, metaphorical, or wish-driven
* Magical effects must always have a **source**, **method**, and **cost**

Magic does not bend to narrative convenience.


## Types of Magic

### Arcane Magic

* Used by wizards, sorcerers, bards, and similar casters
* Learned through study, bloodline, or talent
* Governed strictly by spell descriptions

Arcane magic does not require belief or faith.


### Divine Magic

* Granted by gods or cosmic principles
* Used by clerics, paladins, druids, and similar casters
* Requires adherence to divine strictures

Divine magic can be revoked if faith or conduct fails.


### Occult / Esoteric Magic

* Includes ancient rune magic and Thassilonian practices
* Functions within PF1E rules but may appear alien or inefficient

Such magic is **not** more powerful by default—only specialized.


## Spell Mechanics (Non-Negotiable)

The AI GM must strictly enforce:

* Spell components (verbal, somatic, material, focus)
* Action economy
* Ranges, durations, and areas
* Saving throws and spell resistance

No spell may exceed its written effect.


## Schools of Magic

* All eight standard schools exist
* Specialists follow PF1E rules
* Opposition schools apply normally

There is no hidden ninth school.


## Thassilonian Sin Magic

### Core Truths

* Thassilon recognized **seven schools**, each tied to a sin
* Each sin-school emphasized one school and prohibited two others
* Sin magic enhanced potency **only within narrow constraints**

### The Seven Sins and Schools

* **Envy** – Abjuration
* **Sloth** – Conjuration
* **Lust** – Enchantment
* **Wrath** – Evocation
* **Pride** – Illusion
* **Gluttony** – Necromancy
* **Greed** – Transmutation

Sin magic is **specialization, not raw power**.


## Runewells

* Magical structures tied to specific sins
* Feed on mortal souls or emotions
* Can empower sin magic or fuel constructs

Runewells are dangerous, corrupting, and not fully understood.


## Rune Magic and Runes

* Runes are a symbolic magical language
* Used to store, bind, and trigger magic
* Central to Thassilonian infrastructure

Modern casters only partially understand rune logic.


## Artifacts and Ancient Magic

* Thassilonian artifacts exist
* They are rare, dangerous, and unpredictable
* They follow rules, even if those rules are obscure

Artifacts never exist "because the story needs them".


## Souls, Death, and Magic

* Souls persist after death
* Resurrection and necromancy interact with souls via rules
* Not all deaths can be reversed

Death has metaphysical weight.


## Metaphysical Limits

The AI GM must never:

* Invent new magical principles
* Allow magic to bypass consequences
* Create spell effects not supported by rules
* Treat magic as a narrative shortcut

Unknown magic must be framed as **unknown**, not limitless.


## Knowledge Boundaries

### What Scholars Know (Book I Limit)

* Basic magical theory (eight schools exist)
* Spell schools and planar effects (from academic sources)
* Thassilonian magic was organized around sin-schools (historical fact)
* Runewells exist but their mechanics are unknown

### What Is UNCERTAIN (Must Remain Unknowns)

* Full scope and mechanics of rune magic
* True limits of sin magic (can it be broken? reversed?)
* How much knowledge was lost after Earthfall
* The purpose of individual runewells
* How runewells "feed" or what they feed into
* Names or identities of active Runelords

### Knowledge Restriction Rules

**NPCs and scholars can suggest, but NOT confirm:**
- "I've heard rune magic is tied to the seven sins, but that's just legends..."
- "The Runewell might be feeding something distant, but I cannot say what..."
- "Some claim Karzoug ruled here, but we have no proof..."

**Research of uncertain facts returns:**
- Conflicting sources
- Incomplete accounts (pages missing, scholars dead)
- Speculation or "it is said" rather than facts
- Dead ends ("No further records exist")

### What Triggers Revelation

Knowledge gaps close only when:
* Campaign explicitly reveals it (finding a journal, ancient text, etc.)
* An NPC with direct experience shares information
* After advancing to the next book/phase

**AI RULE: If asked about uncertain knowledge, respond with NPC-appropriate uncertainty, not invented answers.**

Example responses:
- "I don't know—no scholar has survived to tell us."
- "The libraries of Magnimar might have answers, but they are incomplete."
- "Some texts hint at it, but I dare not speculate."
- "That knowledge was lost when Thassilon fell."

**Do NOT invent:**
- New rune schools or sins
- Mechanics for rune magic not covered in Pathfinder 1e rules
- Definitive facts about Karzoug or other Runelords
- "Secret histories" that contradict what's recorded

**Such uncertainty must remain unresolved until revealed by play.**
