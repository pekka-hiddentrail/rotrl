### Lost Coast Road

**Route:** Sandpoint ↔ Magnimar

| Segment | Distance | Travel Time | Hazards |
|---------|----------|-------------|---------|
| Sandpoint → First rest stop | 20 miles | 1.5 days walking | Bandits (rare), weather |
| Road segments (5 total) | 80 miles total | ~5-6 days walking | Bandits, wild animals |
| Magnimar | - | Large city; major trade hub | Urban dangers |

**Road Conditions:**
- Paved in sections (Magnimar → First 30 miles)
- Deteriorates into dirt/gravel further north
- Well-traveled; mostly safe in daylight
- Dangerous at night (recommend inn stops)

**Inns Along the Road:**
- **Bleeding Mermaid** (~20 miles from Sandpoint): Decent condition, full meals available
- **Horse & Plow** (~40 miles south): Farmstead inn, basic but friendly
- Standard inn chain every 15-20 miles (Game Master can place as needed)

## Travel Mechanics

### Movement Rates (Party of Adventurers)

| Condition | Daily Distance | Movement Rate |
|-----------|---|---|
| Road, good weather | 20-24 miles | 30 mph for 8 hours |
| Forest, clear path | 15 miles | 15 mph for 8 hours |
| Forest, no trail | 10 miles | 10 mph for 8 hours |
| Rough terrain (hills, mountains) | 10-12 miles | Variable based on terrain |
| Mounted (horse/pony) | +50% distance | +50% multiplier to rates above |
| Forced march (9-10 hours) | +25% distance | Strength check to avoid exhaustion |

**Rest Requirements:**
- 8 hours sleep needed every 24 hours for spell/resource recovery
- 1 hour rest during travel negates fatigue (not mandatory daily)
- Camping in wilderness: Increase random encounter chance by 1 per 5 miles from civilization

### Weather Effects

**Lost Coast Climate:**
- Fog common (especially near coast; reduces visibility to 30-50 feet)
- Rain frequent (1d4 times per week on average)
- Storms possible (rare; 1d8 days duration)
- Seasonal: Spring/Summer relatively stable; Fall/Winter unpredictable

**Weather Mechanics:**
- Rain: No penalty to overland travel (roads drain)
- Fog: Reduce visibility; Perception checks at -2
- Storm: Movement reduced by 50%, visibility 20 feet or less

## Regional Dangers & Encounters

### Wilderness Encounter Table (Random, per 8 hours travel)

| Terrain | Encounter Type | Examples |
|---------|---|---|

| **Road** | Very Low (1 in 12 chance) | Merchants, bandits, wildlife |
| **Hills/Rough** | Moderate (1 in 6 chance) | Hill giants, wild animals, ruins |
| **Abandoned Ruins** | High (1 in 4 chance) | Undead, constructs, treasure |

**Random Encounter DC:**
Roll 1d20; on 15+, encounter occurs.

## Navigation & Wayfinding

### Pathfinding Mechanics

**DCs for Finding Way:**

| Terrain | DC (Survival check) | Fail Consequence |
|--------|---|---|
| Well-traveled road | N/A (auto-success) | - |
| Road, poor visibility (fog, night) | 10 | Add 1d6 hours to travel |
| Forest trail (marked) | 12 | Add 1d6 hours, risk getting lost |
| Forest, no trail | 15 | Add 2d6 hours, risk wrong direction |
| Wilderness (trackless) | 18 | Party becomes lost; camping required |

**Getting Lost:**
- Failed navigation check by 10+: Party travels wrong direction for 1d4 hours before noticing
- Failed by 5-9: Party's travel time increased, but correct path regained
- Failure by 1-4: Slight delay, minor confusion

### Maps & Information

**Map Available to PCs:**
- Sandpoint has a town map (available at town hall if requested)
- Magnimar maps available from merchants/guild houses
- No detailed wilderness maps exist (Varisia is frontier)
- Rumors/local knowledge can provide outdated information

**NPC Knowledge:**
- Locals can direct to Magnimar, nearby villages
- Old-timers know Thistletop danger exists (vague warnings)
- Merchants have trade route maps (buy for 5-10 gp)

## Distance Reference Chart

### From Sandpoint

| Destination | Distance | Travel Time (Walking) | Travel Time (Mounted) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Magnimar (south) | 80 miles | 5-6 days | 2-3 days |
| Thistletop (north) | 25 miles | 1-2 days | 4-6 hours |
| Lighthouse Point (NW) | 40 miles | 2-3 days | 1 day |
| Mushfens (south) | 120+ miles | 8-10 days | 4-5 days |
| Storvale Plateau (east) | 60+ miles | 4-5 days | 2 days |

## Environmental Hazards

### Terrain-Specific Challenges

**Forests:**
- Dense vegetation (may Climb or Force Open obstacles)
- Poor visibility (twilight under canopy even at noon)
- Navigation harder (Survival DC 12+)

**Coastal Cliffs:**
- High winds (1d6 damage per 100 feet if unsecu

red)
- Unstable stone (DC 12 Climb checks)
- Wave spray (slippery footing, -2 movement)

**Ruins (Thassilonian):**
- Unstable structures (DC 15 Engineering/architecture check to assess safety)
- Magical hazards (unpredictable based on history)
- Treasure (but also traps and constructs)

---

## Altitude & Elevation

### Map Grid (Relative Heights)

* **Sea Level:** Varisian Gulf coast
* **Coastal Bluffs:** Sandpoint sits ~100 feet above sea
* **Plateau/Hills:** 200-400 feet above sea level
* **Storval Plateau:** 1,000+ feet (not early game destination)

**Altitude Effects:**
- No altitude sickness until 10,000+ feet (not relevant to Varisia)
- Higher elevation → cooler, stronger winds, clearer visibility

---

## Astral Navigation

### Sky Landmarks

* **Desna's Veil:** Northern star constellation (navigational reference)
* **Pharasma's Gate:** Southern star cluster
* **Gozreh's Eye:** Bright star due east at dusk

**Mechanically:** A successful Survival or Knowledge (nature) check (DC 12) allows navigation by stars at night
