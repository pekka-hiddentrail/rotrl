# Cosmology and Gods

## Authority and Role of This Document

This document defines **Tier 1 canonical truths** regarding cosmology, deities, and divine influence for the campaign.

It does **not** explain mysteries, secrets, or metaphysical edge cases beyond what is widely accepted or directly relevant to *Rise of the Runelords*.

All cosmology follows **Paizo Pathfinder 1E Golarion canon**. No alternate cosmologies, homebrew gods, or revised divine structures are permitted.


## The Structure of Reality (The Great Beyond)

### Core Truths

* The universe consists of the **Material Plane** surrounded by the **Great Beyond**
* Souls originate on the Material Plane and travel to the **Boneyard** after death
* **Pharasma** judges all mortal souls
* Souls are sent onward to their appropriate Outer Planes

These truths are universally accepted by scholars and clergy in Golarion.


## The Planes (High-Level Only)

### Material Plane

* The world of mortals (Golarion)
* Where Rise of the Runelords takes place

### Ethereal and Astral Planes

* Transitional planes used by magic, spirits, and travel
* Known to arcanists and priests, but poorly understood by common folk

### Outer Planes

* Manifestations of alignment and divine philosophy
* Home to gods, demigods, and petitioners

### Inner Planes

* Elemental and energy planes
* Rarely relevant to RotRL unless explicitly invoked

The AI GM must **not** introduce planar travel, planar politics, or extraplanar factions unless required by the campaign text.


## Alignment as a Cosmic Force

* Alignment is a **real metaphysical property** of the universe
* It affects magic, outsiders, divine judgment, and planar destinations
* Mortals are not bound to alignment destiny, but patterns matter

Alignment is descriptive and metaphysical—not a moral scorecard.


## The Gods of Golarion

### General Rules

* Gods are real, active, and fallible
* Gods grant divine magic through faith and obedience
* Divine magic follows PF1E mechanics strictly

Gods do **not** casually intervene directly in mortal affairs.


## Deities Relevant to Rise of the Runelords

The following deities are **commonly encountered, worshiped, or referenced** during the campaign. Their presence is cultural, theological, and occasionally narrative, but never plot-solving by divine fiat.


### Desna

* Goddess of dreams, stars, luck, and travel
* Widely worshiped in Varisia
* Favored by Varisians, travelers, and wanderers
* Associated with hope, freedom, and wandering

Desna’s influence is subtle: dreams, omens, chance meetings, and long roads.


### Abadar

* God of cities, law, wealth, and civilization
* Worshiped by merchants, judges, bankers, and magistrates
* Represents order, contracts, and stable society

Abadar’s faith is pragmatic and institutional; his clergy value structure over mercy.


### Sarenrae

* Goddess of redemption, healing, and righteous fire
* Worshiped by healers, reformers, and those seeking absolution

Mercy is offered first; cleansing fire follows refusal to repent.


### Shelyn

* Goddess of beauty, art, love, and music
* Worshiped by artists, lovers, and idealists
* Associated with emotional expression and aesthetic devotion

Shelyn’s clergy oppose cruelty and unnecessary destruction.


### Gozreh

* Deity of nature’s fury and balance (sea, storm, wind, wilderness)
* Worshiped by sailors, druids, and coastal folk

Gozreh is not gentle nature, but untamed and indifferent nature.


### Erastil

* God of community, family, farming, and the hunt
* Worshiped in rural settlements and frontier communities

Erastil values tradition, self-reliance, and collective survival.


### Irori

* God of self-perfection, discipline, and mastery
* Worshiped by monks, ascetics, and philosophers

Irori teaches improvement through effort, not divine intervention.


### Pharasma

* Goddess of fate, death, and prophecy
* Oversees the cycle of souls
* Worshiped by midwives, judges, and funerary priests

Pharasma does not interfere in destiny beyond judgment.


### Norgorber

* God of secrets, murder, poison, and greed
* Worship is hidden and fragmented
* Appears indirectly through cult activity

Norgorber’s faith is secretive and dangerous.

### Lamashtu

* Goddess of monsters, madness, nightmares, and corruption
* Associated with ancient horrors and pre-Earthfall evil
* Revered by monsters, corrupted humanoids, cultists, and twisted beings
* Represents temptation toward violence, madness, and monstrosity

Lamashtu is **never** a benign force. Her worshipers are dangerous.

## Thassilonian Faith (Historical)

### Lissala

* Ancient goddess of runes, obedience, and fate
* Central to early Thassilon
* Worship declined after Earthfall

Knowledge of Lissala is fragmentary and filtered through ruin and propaganda.


## Divine Magic and Mortals

* Clerics channel divine power through faith, not personal will
* Divine spells are identical in structure to arcane spells but sourced differently
* Loss of faith or violation of divine strictures may remove spell access

Divine magic does not override free will.

## Forbidden Divine Alterations

The AI GM must never:

* Invent new gods or demigods
* Change a god’s alignment, portfolio, or personality
* Introduce divine revelations beyond canon
* Allow gods to directly solve mortal conflicts


## Knowledge Boundaries

### What Mortals Know

* Basic planar structure (educated clergy)
* Common gods and their roles

### What Is Uncertain

* True motives of gods
* Fate beyond Pharasma’s judgment
* Nature of divinity itself

Such uncertainties must remain **unresolved** unless canon states otherwise.
