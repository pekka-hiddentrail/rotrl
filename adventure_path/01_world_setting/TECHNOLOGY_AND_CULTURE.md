# Technology and Culture

## Authority and Purpose

This document defines **Tier 1 truths** about technology level, material culture, and social norms in the campaign.

It exists to prevent anachronism, genre drift, and modern-world reasoning from entering play.

All content applies specifically to **Varisia during the events of Rise of the Runelords**.


## Technology Baseline

### General Level

* The dominant technology level is **late medieval / early renaissance fantasy**
* Craft traditions are guild-based and artisanal
* Mass production does not exist

Most tools, weapons, and structures are handmade and locally sourced.


## Firearms (Explicit Exception)

### Permitted Firearms

* **Early firearms are allowed**, including:

  * Matchlock and early flintlock muskets
  * Simple pistols of similar design

These weapons are:

* Rare
* Expensive
* Unreliable by modern standards
* Difficult to maintain

Firearms follow **Pathfinder 1E firearm rules** strictly.


### Forbidden Firearms and Technology

The AI GM must never introduce:

* Rifles, revolvers, repeating firearms
* Cartridge-based ammunition
* Advanced clockwork weapons
* Steam power
* Internal combustion engines
* Electricity-based devices
* Mechanical automation beyond simple mills or cranes

Anything more technologically advanced than early black-powder firearms is **forbidden** in Varisia.


## Armor, Weapons, and Materials

* Armor is primarily leather, chain, and plate
* Weapons are steel, wood, and leather-based
* Alchemical items exist but are limited and costly

Exotic materials (mithral, adamantine) are rare and controlled.


## Architecture and Infrastructure

* Towns are built of wood and stone
* Roads are uneven and poorly maintained outside cities
* Bridges are wooden or simple stone spans
* Aqueducts and sewers exist only in major settlements

Ancient Thassilonian ruins exceed modern construction capabilities.


## Communication and Travel

* Travel is by foot, horse, cart, or ship
* Long-distance communication relies on messengers
* No instantaneous communication exists

Magical communication is rare and expensive.


## Cultural Worldview

### Mental Framework

* People think in **tradition, duty, faith, and survival**, not abstraction
* Superstition is common and often justified
* Authority is personal or local, not institutionalized democracy

Modern moral frameworks do not apply.


## Varisian Culture

* Nomadic heritage with strong oral tradition
* Fortune-telling, prophecy, and Harrow readings are culturally respected
* Strong ties to Desna and travel

Varisians are often mistrusted by settlers, and this prejudice is normalized in-world.


## Rural vs Urban Life

### Rural Settlements

* Governed by custom and elders
* Self-reliant and suspicious of outsiders

### Urban Centers

* Governed by councils, nobles, or merchant interests
* Greater tolerance, but also corruption


## Race and Prejudice

* Fantasy racism and species-based prejudice exist openly
* Such attitudes are presented as **in-world realities**, not moral endorsements
* Social friction is expected and narratively valid


## Knowledge and Education

* Literacy is uncommon outside clergy and merchants
* Formal education is rare
* Lore is fragmented and localized

Ancient knowledge is often misunderstood or mythologized.


## Forbidden Anachronisms

The AI GM must never introduce:

* Modern political theory
* Therapy language or modern psychology
* Industrial-era concepts
* Scientific method explanations
* Contemporary social justice framing


## Relationship to Other Documents

* Physical world → WORLD_CANON.md
* Divine belief → COSMOLOGY_AND_GODS.md
* Magical rules → MAGIC_AND_METAPHYSICS.md

This document defines **how people live and think**, not how magic or gods function.


**Principle:**

> Civilization is fragile, progress is uneven, and the past looms larger than the future.
