# World Canon

## Authority and Scope

This document defines **Tier 1 Canon** for this campaign.

**Primary Authorities (highest to lowest):**

1. *Rise of the Runelords* Adventure Path (all six volumes + Player’s Guide)
2. *Varisia, Birthplace of Legends*
3. *Sandpoint, Light of the Lost Coast*

If contradictions arise, **Rise of the Runelords overrides all other sources**.

This document is intentionally incomplete. Anything not listed here is either:

* Background knowledge only, or
* Subject to Emergent Canon rules


## World Identity

* **Planet:** Golarion
* **Continent:** Avistan
* **Region:** Varisia (northwestern Avistan)
* **Primary Campaign Area:** Lost Coast, Varisia

Varisia is a frontier land layered over the ruins of the ancient empire of **Thassilon**, whose influence actively shapes the campaign.


## Deep History (Immutable)

### Earthfall

* Occurred ~10,000 years ago
* Destroyed Azlant and ended the Age of Destiny
* Caused massive geological upheaval, including the collapse of Bakrakhan into the sea

### Thassilon

* Founded by **First King Xin** over 11,000 years ago
* Ruled by seven **Runelords**, each embodying a sin-magic specialization
* Depended on rune magic, rune giants, enslaved giants and dragons
* Fell during Earthfall; most knowledge of its true nature is lost or mythologized

### The Seven Runelords (Known to History)

* **Karzoug** – Greed (Transmutation) – ruler of Shalast
* **Alaznist** – Wrath (Evocation) – ruler of Bakrakhan
* Others exist but are not initially relevant unless revealed by the campaign


## Thassilonian Magic (Fixed Truths)

* Magic organized around **seven sin-specialized schools**
* Each sin-school prohibits two opposing schools
* Rune magic is real, dangerous, and partially incomprehensible to modern scholars
* **Runewells** extract soul energy keyed to specific sins
* **Sihedron Rune** symbolizes unified Thassilonian sin magic

AI must not invent new sin-schools, runelords, or rune laws.


## Geography: Varisia

### Major Regions

* **Lost Coast** – foggy, rugged coastline; primary campaign region
* **Varisian Gulf** – formed after Bakrakhan sank
* **Mushfens** – swampy southern border region
* **Fogscar Mountains** – inland mountain range
* **Kodar Mountains** – far north; location of Xin-Shalast


## The Lost Coast

A sparsely populated frontier region marked by:

* Rocky cliffs and limestone tors
* Redwood forests inland
* Persistent fog and rain
* Scattered Varisian camps and shrines to Desna

Civilization is recent and fragile.


## Sandpoint (Primary Hub)

### Identity

* Known as **“The Light of the Lost Coast”**
* Founded in 4666 AR
* Built atop ancient Thassilonian ruins (Catacombs of Wrath)

### Demographics

* Population ~1,200
* Predominantly human, with small nonhuman minorities

### Governance

* Mayor-led town council
* Nominally independent but culturally tied to Magnimar

### Cultural Tension

* Founded by Chelish-descended merchant families
* Built through a fragile compact with local Varisians
* History includes betrayal, violence, and uneasy reconciliation

### Known Threat Legacy

* The Late Unpleasantness
* Goblin raids
* Thassilonian ruins beneath the town

Sandpoint is narratively **central**. Details here are stable and must not drift.


## Shoanti and Varisians

### Shoanti

* Indigenous inhabitants of Varisia
* Organized into seven **quahs** (nations)
* Deeply spiritual, animistic, tradition-bound
* Generally hostile or distrustful of settlers

### Varisians

* Nomadic people distinct from Shoanti
* Strong cultural ties to Desna and prophecy
* Harrow readings and oral tradition are culturally significant


## Major Cities (Context Only)

* **Magnimar** – nearest major city; political and economic influence
* **Korvosa** – distant; not directly active in RotRL
* **Riddleport** – lawless northern port; background relevance only

AI should not shift campaign focus away from the Lost Coast unless directed.


## Xin-Shalast

* Ancient capital of Shalast
* Hidden high in the Kodar Mountains
* Associated with Karzoug’s return
* Exists at a metaphysical boundary between worlds

Details of Xin-Shalast are revealed **only as the campaign progresses**.


## Canon Guardrails

The AI MUST:

* Treat Thassilon as real, not mythic abstraction
* Treat modern ignorance of Thassilon as genuine
* Avoid inventing new ancient truths unless explicitly uncovered
* Preserve mystery and fragmentation of historical knowledge

The AI MUST NOT:

* Retroactively alter known events
* Add new Runelords or sin-schools
* Reveal late-campaign truths prematurely


## Relationship to Emergent Canon

* This document defines **what cannot change**
* `EMERGENT_CANON.md` defines **what becomes true through play**
* In case of conflict: WORLD_CANON > EMERGENT_CANON > Improvisation
