# Emergent Canon Ledger

This document records **Tier 2 invented facts** that become binding for campaign continuity.

**Authority Level:** Sits below RotRL + Paizo canon + project documents, but binding within this campaign after entry.

By maintaining this ledger, we prevent drift, contradict canon, and create an auditable record of all AI-invented world facts.

---

## Entry Format

Each ledger entry includes:

```
ID: EC-NNNN (unique identifier)
Type: [NPC / Place / Organization / Custom / Obligation / Item / Rumor]
Name: [proper name if applicable]
Summary: [1-3 line description of the invented fact]
Tier: [2 or Rumor (Tier 3)]
Session/Chapter: [where introduced - e.g., "Session 1, Swallowtail Festival"]
Impact: [what campaign elements can be affected by this fact]
Constraints: [canon elements this CANNOT contradict]
Status: [Active / Retired / Retconned]
Notes: [any additional context]
```

---

## Active Entries (Tier 2)

### EC-0001
**Type:** NPC  
**Name:** [To be filled]  
**Summary:** [Minor NPC invented during play]  
**Tier:** 2  
**Session/Chapter:** [To be recorded]  
**Impact:** Local reputation and information  
**Constraints:** Must not replace or contradict named canon NPCs  
**Status:** Active  
**Notes:** Template entry—delete and replace when AI invents first minor NPC

---

## Rumor Entries (Unverified Tier 3)

These are **in-world rumors, legends, or theories** that may or may not be true. They must be clearly framed as uncertain.

### Rumors (Book I)

[None yet—to be recorded if PCs encounter unverified lore about Thassilon, the Runelords, or Sandpoint history]

---

## Retired Entries

[None yet—retained for historical reference if entries are later overprinted]

---

## Retconned Entries

[None yet—if an entry conflicts with later canon discovery, it is marked retconned with reason]

---

## Authority and Binding

**This ledger is binding for internal consistency only after entry is written.**

- Sits below RotRL, Paizo canon, and project documents
- If an entry contradicts higher authority, it must be retconned (not silently changed)
- Each entry records where it was introduced so consequences can be traced

**Usage Rule:**

> Before the AI invents any Tier 2 fact (minor NPC, local custom, organization, place name, or obligation), it updates this ledger. Later sessions reference the ledger to maintain consistency.

---

## Retcon Protocol

If a correction is discovered:

1. Add a new entry under "Retconned Entries" marked with reason
2. Record the old entry ID for reference
3. Keep both for audit trail

Example retcon entry:

```
Retconned: EC-0002 (reference old entry)
Reason: Discovered NPC name contradicted Session 3 canon. Replaced with EC-0002b.
New Entry: EC-0002b
```
